### PACE Sales Process Overview

- Lead qualification process from unqualified → fully sales qualified → enrollment
    
- Three primary lead sources generating volume:
    
    - Field sales (outreach specialists): ~40 people
        
    - Broker sales: expanding channel with FMO relationships via Sherry
        
    - Digital marketing: ~$1M/month spend, handled by 10-person contact center
        
- Target: 55 actively selling reps across all channels
    
- Customer lifetime value: ~$100K per participant
    

### Field Sales Pipeline Issues

- Current performance gaps identified:
    
    - Inside sales: 2 days average qualification time
        
    - Field sales: 5 days average qualification time (2.5x slower)
        
    - Pipeline cleanup needed: 415 days average for closed leads
        
- Major problem: OSes not managing pipelines effectively
    
    - Linda: 379 open leads
        
    - Multiple reps with 100+ stale leads from 2022-2024
        
    - Self-generated leads sitting unworked
        
- Immediate opportunity: Train top 10-20 worst performers on new Power BI dashboard usage
    

### FMO Channel Structure

- FMOs provide agents with:
    
    - Technology systems and tools
        
    - Voice vault recording requirements (10-year archive)
        
    - Access to 20+ different insurance products
        
    - Compliance management
        
- Commission structure for PACE:
    
    - Initial enrollment: $250 (FMO) + $600-700 (agent by state)
        
    - 13-month retention bonus: $200 (FMO) + $390 (agent)
        
    - 2026 rates increase per CMS fair market value
        
- Similar to real estate model - licensed professionals selling restricted products
    

### Lead Generation Challenges

- Digital marketing difficulties targeting seniors:
    
    - Must be 55+, in correct ZIP, right sickness level, financially qualified
        
    - “Goldilocks zone” - sick enough but not too sick
        
    - Pride factor: seniors don’t disclose struggles initially
        
- Caregiver-initiated leads convert 3x better than self-initiated
    
- Current volume: 3,300 leads/month through contact center
    

### Technology Stack

- Power BI dashboards: New participant leads pipeline (1 month old)
    
- Microsoft Dynamics CRM: Main system for field sales
    
- Five9: Contact center phone system with click-to-call
    
- Invoka: Call recording, transcription, attribution tracking
    
- Marketing automation platform (MAP): Underutilized for nurture sequences
    

### Enrollment Process Deep Dive

- Two-hour in-home intake meeting covers:
    
    - Financial documents (2-5 year lookback required)
        
    - Medication lists and health history
        
    - ADL (Activities of Daily Living) assessment
        
    - Scheduling nurse for Level of Care (LOC) assessment
        
- Three required approvals before enrollment:
    
    - Financial (Medicaid eligibility): 34% approval rate - biggest bottleneck
        
    - Functional (Level of Care): Highest approval rate
        
    - HSD (Health & Safety Determination): Internal committee review
        
- Average time from intake to benefits: 61 days
    

### Sales Enablement Priorities

- Primary responsibility: Sales playbook development for 100-person field team
    
- Support structure:
    
    - Regional Sales Directors oversee Outreach Specialists
        
    - Enrollment Managers oversee Enrollment Reps
        
    - Contact center requires less attention (Glenn’s direct oversight)
        
- Immediate focus areas:
    
    - Pipeline management training
        
    - Intake script standardization
        
    - FMO channel support
        
- Workload: Carrying 1.5 FTE worth of responsibilities (requested 2 FTEs, got 0.5)
    

### Next Steps

- Continue regular training sessions to accelerate learning curve
    
- Focus on highest-impact initiatives first
    
- Request Copilot access for AI-assisted form completion
    
- Implement Teams recording/transcription for intake meetings

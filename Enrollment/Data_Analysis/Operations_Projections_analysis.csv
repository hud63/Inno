Dm: May be SNF appropriate; needs placement prior to enrollment if he feels housing is unsafe

Previous review: Pending: Is he wanting to move soon and does he need to go to a SNF? 
Speak to the RN what level of care might be needed.
Current Review: For Robert Blache he is needing assistance with bathing, needs assistance with dressing, wheelchair bound, needs assistance with toileting (cleaning up mostly), needs assistance with medications (has nurse coming currently to set up meds), transportation assistance (not scheduling but needs rides), light housekeeping and laundry assistance, and is incontinent with bowel at times. He would benefit from assisted living if there is one that can meet all of those assistance needs. Part of the problem is where he lives and it not being completely handicap accessible (ie bathing).

PPT is having issues with his current roommate and due to this, he will be moving on Monday but unknown to where. 
Rep to follow and confirm if the ppt is moving. If he is, when and where? We are not contracted with Well Power and he is seeing them for behavioral health.

9/18/25: Previous review: Hold: Rep to follow and confirm if the ppt is moving. If he is, when and where? We are not contracted with Well Power and he is seeing them for behavioral health.
Current Review: Gateway to success. Not very happy at his current location but does not have any plans to move. He is having issues with his roommate. Would like to move into an ALF. Concerns that his classes are court ordered and going thru Gateway. Unsure of how they are being paid for.

9/23/25: Previous review: Pending regional review. 
Current review: The guidance from legal is clear – we don’t have the right to access parole officers or other court directives, unless it is apparent that there may be restrictions in place that would prevent us from serving him.  So questions like, ‘will he be able to attend the day center’ or ‘does he have any restrictions we need to know about’ are fair game for the Gateway case manager, but there it ends.","2232 Norman Ln

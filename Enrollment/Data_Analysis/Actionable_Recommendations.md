# Actionable Recommendations Based on Enrollment Data Analysis
**Generated:** October 8, 2025
**Priority Level:** High Impact, Immediate Implementation

---

## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (First 30 Days)

### 1. Mental Health Crisis Intervention
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Quality care, risk reduction, potential revenue

**Action Items:**
- **Immediate referral pathway** for 16 participants with untreated mental health diagnoses
- **Partner with behavioral health providers** for 7-day warm handoff protocol
- **Assign care manager** to track treatment initiation for this cohort
- **Create mental health screening protocol** for all new enrollments

**Expected Outcome:** Reduce 66.7% treatment gap, improve care quality, decrease crisis events

---

### 2. Workload Rebalancing
**Priority:** HIGH
**Impact:** Staff burnout prevention, care quality

**Current Imbalance:**
- Dana Lewis: 14 cases (25.9% of total)
- Top 3 Outreach Specialists: 50% of caseload

**Action Items:**
- **Redistribute 2-3 high-risk cases** from Dana Lewis to underloaded specialists
- **Create balanced caseload thresholds**: 4-6 cases per specialist
- **Implement risk-adjusted staffing** (high-risk cases count as 1.5 cases)
- **Develop backup coverage system** for high-volume specialists

**Staff Reassignments Recommended:**
```
From: Dana Lewis (14 cases, avg risk 1.5)
To: Alexander Shudt, KeSha Smith (1-3 cases each)
Priority: High-risk, complex cases first
```

---

### 3. Data Quality Infrastructure
**Priority:** HIGH
**Impact:** Workflow automation, reporting, compliance

**Critical Issues:**
- Review Status: 100% blank
- Completeness Score: 100% blank
- Non-standard "none" variations across 15+ fields

**Action Items:**
- **Make Review Status required** with dropdown: Not Started/In Progress/Completed
- **Auto-calculate Completeness Score** (% of required fields populated)
- **Standardize "none" responses** to single code across all fields
- **Implement real-time validation** for missing critical data

**Immediate Fix (Week 1):**
```excel
Add Review Status column with required validation
Add Completeness Score formula
Replace all "none/No/N/A" variations with "None"
```

## ðŸ“ˆ STRATEGIC INITIATIVES (30-90 Days)

### 4. Risk Stratification System
**Priority:** HIGH
**Impact:** Resource allocation, care planning

**Risk Scoring Model:**
```
Risk Flags (1 point each):
- Fall history (81.5% of participants)
- Incontinence (83.3%)
- Oxygen use (68.5%)
- Dialysis needs (74.1%)
- Missed medications (14.8%)

Risk Categories:
0-1 points: Low risk (16.7%)
2 points: Moderate risk (16.7%)
3+ points: High risk (66.7%)
```

**Implementation:**
- **Auto-calculate risk score** in enrollment system
- **Color-code dashboard** by risk level
- **Adjust staffing ratios** based on risk distribution
- **Create high-touch protocols** for 3+ risk participants

---

### 5. Center-Specific Care Protocols
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Impact:** Operational efficiency, patient satisfaction

**Center-Specific Insights:**
- **Lakewood (23 participants):** Highest assisted living concentration
- **Denver (13 participants):** 69% live alone - needs transportation focus
- **Thornton (14 participants):** Highest mental health diagnosis rate

**Protocol Development:**
```
Lakewood: Facility coordination playbook (med passes, DME installs)
Denver: Home-based logistics (transportation, safety checks)
Thornton: Mental health integration protocols
```

**Resource Allocation:**
- **59.5% of resources** to top 3 centers
- **Transportation priority** for Denver's living-alone population
- **Behavioral health integration** for Thornton

---

### 6. Residence Type Care Playbooks
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Care consistency, staff training

**Two Primary Tracks:**

**Track A: Assisted Living (36.5% of cohort)**
- **Facility coordination protocols**
- **Medication administration procedures**
- **On-site DME installation workflows**
- **Cross-organization communication templates**

**Track B: Living Alone (40.5% of cohort)**
- **Transportation scheduling system**
- **Home safety assessment protocols**
- **Medication setup and reminder systems**
- **Wellness check cadence (minimum weekly)**
- **Emergency response procedures**

---

## ðŸ’° FINANCIAL & GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

### 7. Referral Channel Optimization
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Growth efficiency, marketing ROI

**Channel Performance Analysis:**
- **Community-based orgs:** 33.3% of enrollments - INCREASE investment
- **Government sources:** 27.8% - MAINTAIN current levels
- **Assisted living facilities:** Only 7.4% - GROWTH opportunity
- **Healthcare professionals:** 5.6% - UNDERUTILIZED channel

**Action Items:**
- **Double down on community org partnerships** (highest conversion)
- **Develop targeted ALF outreach program** (growth potential)
- **Create healthcare professional referral network** (underutilized)
- **Track channel-specific ROI** for future budget allocation

---

### 8. High-Risk Care Management
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Impact:** Cost containment, quality metrics

**Economic Reality:**
- **High-risk participants (66.7%):** Will consume 80% of resources
- **Independent living residents:** Profit center (40.5% of cohort)
- **Multiple risk factors:** Higher care costs, potential churn risk

**Financial Strategies:**
- **Proactive care management** for high-risk participants (reduce expensive events)
- **Retention focus** for independent living residents (preserve profit centers)
- **Early intervention protocols** to prevent expensive hospitalizations
- **Length-of-stay optimization** by living situation

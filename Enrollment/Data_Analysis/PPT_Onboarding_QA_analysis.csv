Other:  60 y/o male Army veteran currently residing in a back house with his dog for the past 4 yrs. He is calm and cooperative, A&Ox4, and able to confirm his address and phone number, and initiate phone calls independently. Reports he is unemployed, has a vocational-level education, and receives medical care through the VA. He has no POA, Conservator, Guardian, or Living Will, and lists Larry Cluff (friend) 804-972-0124 as his Emergency Contact. VS: BP 152/94 T 99.0 P 99 02 R 18 02 Sat 95% on RA. NKDA reported. He reports increasing difficulty with IADLs, including shopping, meal preparation, cleaning, and laundry, d/t chronic pain, fatigue, and SOB. He ambulates independently but reports weakness and exertional dyspnea, including difficulty standing from a seated position. Ppt states his medical history includes esophageal cancer (2005) and states he was treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and described having his esophagus removed and his stomach “sewn to the remaining part of the esophagus.” He reports being cancer-free and no longer followed by oncology. Suffers from severe GERD with recurrent aspiration pneumonia, requiring him to sleep in a Fowler’s position. GI referral is in place, appt. not yet scheduled. Reports recent urinary retention d/t BPH; Foley catheter placed 07/2025, now removed. He is experiencing intermittent incontinence and wears pull-ups. Weekly home health visits for vitals and mediation oversight. Missed PCP appt. on 08/20/25, rescheduled for 08/26/25. Currently not followed by urology. Possible liver abnormalities identified during bladder ultrasound; referred to hepatology. Virtual appt. scheduled for 09/22/25. Diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (unspecified); followed by cardiology Q 6 mos., next appt. 10/16/25. Reports pre-diabetes, BG average 120-140mg/dL. A1C unknown. Suffers from chronic cervical spine and bilateral shoulder pain with worsening ROM and muscle spasms LUE, likely service-related (former paratrooper). Also reports tinnitus, chronic dizziness, and impaired balance, and impaired near vision (optometry scheduled 09/05/25). Receives telehealth psychiatric care for PTSD, anxiety, and depression, with triggers including loud noise. Denies SI/HI, hallucinations, or paranoia, but reports neighbors are monitoring him with cameras and occasional verbal aggression when provoked. Ppt reports he has been using methamphetamine “on and off for 25 yrs” and continues to use “once every 6 weeks.” Reports last period of sobriety lasted 8 yrs. following prior recovery program. States use is stress and isolation triggered. When asked if his physician is aware of his drug use, he responded, “I was given this nasal spray,” while pointed to a box of naloxone nasal spray. He denied ever administering it himself, denied any hospitalizations, incarceration, or evictions r/t the drug use, and did not elaborate further. Disclosure suggests possible prior risk of opioid exposure, but full context remains unclear. Provided education on the importance of calling 911 immediately if naloxone is used. Denies alcohol or tobacco use. Denies h/o amputation or prosthetic, Trach, Injections, CPAP, BiPAP, Ventilator, or O2. Reports forgetfulness with medications and medical appointments, attributed to either mental health, substance use, or cognitive decline. He recently misplaced several medications during home reorganization and was only able to present a few during today’s visit. He states that he plans to continue to search for the missing medications. Provided education on the importance of medication adherence, including taking medications as prescribed, avoiding missed doses, and notifying healthcare providers if medications are lost or inaccessible. Ppt has complex medical needs with functional independence in ADLs but significant limitation in IADLs. Chronic fatigue, cardiovascular disease, respiratory symptoms, and limited mobility are impacting safety and self-care. Lower extremity symptoms (edema, varicose veins, healed wounds, dry skin) are concerning for chronic venous insufficiency or possible PAD. These finding may require further vascular evaluation and ongoing wound care. Current stimulant use places Mr. Wasek at risk for poor medical compliance, exacerbation of MH symptoms, and functional decline. He is socially isolated, lacks CG and transportation support, and is overwhelmed by medical care coordination. He is concerned with his living situation d/t conflict with the landlord and issues r/t pet ownership; he identified Veteran Village (Redlands, CA) as backup housing option. He also demonstrates a strong interest in ADHC for socialization, structured support, and medical monitoring.

Other: 80 y/o Spanish speaking female w/limited English proficiency who currently resides in a SNF since 5/2024. NKA. Her sister, who is actively involved in her care and also serves as an interpreter, is present during this assessment. Ppt was admitted to the SNF following hospitalization d/t failure to thrive, malnutrition, acute kidney failure, and confusion. Prior to admission, she was the PCG for her terminally ill husband. The emotional burden and stress of caregiving led her to neglect her own health. She stopped taking her meds and eating, resulting in significant weight loss, frailty, and progressive weakness, ultimately making her unable to care for herself or her husband. Her son contacted EMS, which led to her hospital admission and subsequent transfer to the SNF. Ppt reports she had postponed bilateral hip replacement for 4 yrs. in order to continue caring for her husband. She eventually underwent a left hip replacement 1/2025 and right hip 3/2025. She was last evaluated by her orthopedic specialist 5/2025 and reports she has healed well. She is currently ambulating independently without DME. She reports she is being monitored by her PCP for cystic liver disease. She denies any h/o epilepsy, alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. She is A&Ox3, presents cognitively intact and insightful. SLUMS 25/30. However, she experiences emotional distress and reports feeling overwhelmed by tasks such as medication mgmt., meal preparation, and housekeeping. She has seen her psychiatrist only once since arriving at the SNF. Functionally, she is independent with some limitations. She requires assistance with LB dressing unable to bend forward and uses a sock aid. She has difficulty putting on her shoes and cannot reach her feet for toenail care, for which she requests podiatry services. She prefers stand by assist for showers d/t safety concerns, especially during fibromyalgia flare-ups that exacerbate pain and reduce her mobility. She expresses that she does not feel safe entering the shower alone and needs help washing her LB. She is continent of b/b. She can operate her cellphone in case of an emergency. She requires assistance with grocery shopping, medication mgmt., cooking, laundry, and housekeeping. She states that meal prep is too complex and mentally exhausting. Cleaning and organizing tasks are similarly overwhelming for her, which she attributes in part to her bipolar disorder. Her sister reports that she is prone to impulsive spending and needs supervision with financial decisions. Ppt agrees and acknowledges her need for assistance in making appropriate choices. Her sister currently manages her finances. She previously received IHSS while living alone, but the limited hours provided were insufficient. She struggled to complete household tasks when the CG was not present, contributing to feelings of depression and anxiety. She denies SI.

One week ago, she started receiving weekly Bridge Home Health services for vital signs and medication management.

Medical Hx: AFib, followed by cardiology every 3 mos. Right hip replacements x5 (2000-2020) with confirmed cobalt-chromium poisoning. Chronic right hip pain radiating to back. Bilateral knee replacement (early 2000’s). Arthritis in knees and hands. H/o multiple falls; in 2019 with hospitalizations and rehab, last fall 4-5 mos. ago (no medical care sought). GI symptoms including abdominal swelling and pain (seen by PCP 02/2025, referred to GI, paperwork lost, outcome unknown). H/o UTI’s, with ER visits x2 within the past 2 months; ppt attributes to inability to shower (has been sponge bathing at kitchen sink x9 yrs.).

Ppt has multiple chronic and complex medical issues compounded by limited mobility, cognitive concerns, and environmental safety risks. Her home is cluttered, and she reports misplacing important healthcare documents, but there are clear pathways to navigate the home. She lacks understanding of her current medications, stores them in Ziploc bags, and is in need of medication reminders and organization assistance. She requires assistance with ADLs/IADLs, especially hygiene, d/t her inability to access a shower and arthritis related limitations. She is unable to drive and receives occasional assistance from a friend for grocery shopping. She ambulates slowly with a 2WW, reports SOB on exertion and has a high fall risk. Skin is intact, no current wounds reported. She independently contacts primary care when needed, and follow-through is limited d/t memory, mobility, and organizational issues. Diet is low-sodium, low-fat; however, poor dentition and reflux complicate nutrition.

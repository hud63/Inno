## Executive Summary

This analysis reveals a **high-risk, clinically complex enrollment cohort** requiring intensive care coordination and resource allocation. Key findings show significant mental health treatment gaps, functional limitations, and geographic concentrations that demand strategic operational planning.

## Key Findings

### Clinical Risk Profile

#### **High-Risk Cohort Characteristics**
- **66.7%** of participants have **3+ risk flags** (falls, incontinence, oxygen, dialysis, missed meds)
- **81.5%** have documented fall history
- **83.3%** experience incontinence issues
- **68.5%** require oxygen support
- **74.1%** have dialysis needs
- **14.8%** report medication adherence issues

#### **Mental Health Crisis**
- **44.4%** (24/54) have documented mental health diagnoses
- **66.7% treatment gap** - 16 out of 24 with diagnoses are NOT receiving treatment
- Only **14.8%** (8/54) are currently receiving licensed behavioral health care

### Demographics & Referral Patterns

#### **Referral Channel Effectiveness**
- **Community-based organizations:** 33.3% (dominant source)
- **Government sources:** 27.8%
- **Assisted living facilities:** Only 7.4%
- **Healthcare professionals:** 5.6%

#### **Workload Distribution Imbalances**
**Enrollment Representatives:**
- Claudia Dievendorf: 12 enrollments (22.2% of total)
- Jamie Randolph, Juber Andino, Michelle Gloster: 10 each (18.5% each)
- Bottom 4 reps: 12 enrollments combined (22.2%)

**Outreach Specialists:**
- Dana Lewis: 14 cases (25.9% of total)
- Top 3 specialists handle 50% of caseload

### Geographic & Operational Insights

#### **Center Load Distribution**
- **Lakewood:** 23.0% (17 participants) - Highest volume
- **Thornton:** 18.9% (14 participants)
- **Denver:** 17.6% (13 participants)
- **Top 3 centers:** 59.5% of total enrollment volume

#### **Residence Type Implications**
- **Assisted Living:** 36.5% (27 participants)
- **Living Alone:** 40.5% (30 participants)
- **With Family:** 17.6% (13 participants)

**Critical operational insight:** 40.5% live alone, requiring more transportation, home safety interventions, and medication management support.

## Statistical Correlations

### Risk Factor Clustering
Participants with multiple risk factors show patterns:
- **Fall history + Incontinence:** High correlation (68.5% have both)
- **Oxygen use + Dialysis:** 64.8% overlap
- **Missed medications** strongly associated with living alone (75% of missed med group)

### Geographic Risk Distribution
- **Lakewood:** Highest concentration of assisted living residents
- **Denver:** Highest concentration of participants living alone (69% of Denver cohort)
- **Thornton:** Mixed distribution with highest mental health diagnosis rate

## Data Quality Issues

### Missing Workflow Elements
- **Review Status:** 100% blank - prevents workflow tracking
- **Completeness Score:** 100% blank - no quality metrics
- **Standardization issues:** "none/No/N/A" variations across 15+ fields

### Critical Gaps
- No caregiver co-residency tracking
- No prior home care hours documentation
- Limited referral source detail for ROI analysis

---

## Financial Implications

### Revenue Impact by Residence Type
Based on unit economics mentioned in existing analysis:
- **Independent living:** Profit center (40.5% of cohort)
- **Assisted living:** Break-even (36.5% of cohort)
- **High-acuity (multiple risk factors):** Increased care costs

### Resource Allocation Needs
- **Top 3 centers:** Require 60% of resources
- **High-risk participants (66.7%):** Will consume 80% of care coordination bandwidth
- **Mental health treatment gap:** Represents both quality risk and growth opportunity

---

## Comparison with Prior Analysis

**Validation of findings:** Current statistical analysis validates and quantifies trends identified in prior qualitative review:
- Confirmed 66.7% high-risk rate (vs. estimated in prior analysis)
- Validated mental health treatment gap at 66.7%
- Quantified workload imbalances across staff

**New insights:**
- Identified specific concentration of high-risk participants by Outreach Specialist
- Mapped residence types to specific centers for targeted interventions
- Discovered data quality barriers preventing workflow automation

---

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Risk Stratification:** Implement automatic risk scoring based on the 5 identified flags
2. **Workload Rebalancing:** Redistribute high-risk cases from overloaded specialists
3. **Mental Health Bridge:** Create immediate referral pathway for 16 participants with untreated diagnoses
4. **Data Quality Fix:** Make Review Status and Completeness Score required fields
5. **Center-Specific Playbooks:** Develop different protocols for assisted living vs. living alone populations

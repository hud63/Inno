### New Team Member Introduction
- Mark Newagemedia joined as sales enablement and broker analytics specialist
    - Two weeks into role supporting both sales enablement and broker analytics functions
    - Background: primarily sales with Cardone, sold higher ticket packages (fitness, biz app)
    - Five years at sales agency experience
    - Located in Deerfield Beach, Florida (near Fort Lauderdale)
    - Role focus: making sales team successful through enablement and analytics
- Integration with inside sales team:
    - Will provide call support using automated QA tool
    - Listen to calls to identify tips, tricks, and best practices
    - Help bake successful approaches into day-to-day operations
    - Act as go-to person for customer phrases beginning with “wouldn’t it be nice if”
    - Create universal answers for customer requests and roll out across all teams
    - Collaborate on documentation and FAQ development

### Daily Update Methodology Changes
- Removed inbound call tracking from daily reports effective immediately
    - Conversation with Tony yesterday identified accuracy concerns
    - Cannot tell with 100% certainty how many are inbound calls
    - Moving to digital-only tracking for truthfulness and accuracy
    - Prevents team from using potentially inaccurate information in business decisions
- Attribution complexity explained:
    - Inside sales vs outside sales = one Venn diagram
    - Channels = separate Venn diagram
    - Multiple touch points create multiple attribution sources
    - This complexity “messes up the Venn diagram” for accurate reporting
- Only digital metrics will be considered reliable truth source going forward

### Broker Operations Protocol & Terminology
- Critical terminology corrections for broker interactions:
    - Use “applicants” not “leads” when speaking with brokers
    - Reference team as “contact center” not “inside sales”
    - Rationale: Many brokers deal with inside sales teams from other companies that literally poach their applicants and steal their money
    - At InnovAge, both inside sales team and brokers get paid - transparent arrangement
- Broker lead workflow requirements:
    - All leads must originate from E123 system to maintain proper commission tracking
    - E123 contains all necessary IDs, tags, and attribution data for commission flow
    - Converting leads outside E123 breaks the connection and creates tracking problems
- Spouse/additional applicant example (Amber’s case):
    - Wife submitted application, husband also interested
    - Correct process: Capture husband’s info but pause processing
    - Mark transcribed all information back into E123 system
    - Created intentional “duplicate” lead in E123 for proper tracking
    - Converting verbal lead directly would break commission attribution
- Inbound broker calls without existing application:
    - Must direct broker to submit application through portal first
    - Explanation: “Really need you to submit the application so it ensures you get paid and we have the paper trail for commissions”
    - This approach gets broker cooperation since they want their commissions
    - No application in system = require portal submission before proceeding

### Presumptive Close Approach for Broker Leads
- Broker leads are qualitatively different from web leads:
    - Brokers typically have years-long relationships with seniors
    - Already sold Medicare/Medicaid Advantage plans to same clients
    - PACE timing occurs when senior’s life situation makes it appropriate fit
    - Broker has already “sold PACE into them” to some degree
    - Leads are “hotter” - seniors closer to “yes on PACE” than web leads raising hand for info
- Adjusted conversation approach:
    - More presumptive: “I just want to confirm the information that your broker provided you and answer any additional questions you may have”
    - Run through detailed application information (broker leads contain more complete data)
    - Less focus on value proposition and convincing
    - Still maintain solid intake process for enroller success
    - Continue covering activities of daily living and eligibility explanations
    - Enroller still needs signature on contract, so thorough preparation remains critical
- Glenn working on exact scripting language
- Expectation: should result in more SQLs with “slam dunk” approach

### Assisted Living Facility Lead Management
- David Gomez accepting new role processing ALF inbound leads
    - Current situation: ALF leads don’t align with mission of keeping people home longer
    - ALF residents typically not profitable for InnovAge
    - Business principle: “can’t lose money on every deal and make up for it in volume”
- Phased geographic rollout:
    - Phase 1: Colorado (first state to transition)
    - Phase 2: California, specifically San Bernardino county
    - Phase 3: Rest of organization
    - Legal and operational “Lego blocks” still being aligned on backend
- ALF business model problems:
    - ALFs have residents unable to pay their housing costs
    - They view PACE as “free meal ticket” - getting InnovAge to pay housing money
    - ALF cannot discharge residents if they’re not safe enough (certification risk)
    - Broken residents with nowhere to go can’t be sent “home”
    - Only winner in arrangement is ALF, not senior or InnovAge
    - InnovAge has terminated contracts with ALFs for system abuse
- David’s dual responsibilities:
    - Primary: Process ALF leads with focus on explaining alternative resources
    - Secondary: Continue in regular call queues when not handling ALF cases
    - Over next 90 days, expect increasing percentage of time on ALF leads
- Lead handling process:
    - Live calls mentioning ALF: continue normal process (“don’t throw fish back in lake”)
    - Digital leads clearly indicating ALF status: reassign to David
    - David will explain what resources exist outside PACE program
    - Goal: ensure seniors make best decision for them, not just what ALF coordinator suggests

### Resource Documentation Development
- Sandra Brownell’s team creating state-specific resource guides
    - Written format covering resources available to seniors outside PACE
    - Colorado priority (aligns with ALF rollout phase 1)
    - Will expand to all InnovAge states
    - No specific timeline committed but expected quickly
- Distribution and training:
    - David will receive materials first
    - All inside sales team will also receive same information
    - Ensures consistent messaging across all team members
    - Mark will help convert into formal documentation
    - Goal: shared resource for entire team
- Documentation reminder from leadership:
    - Team encouraged to raise hand when feeling “in the dark”
    - Leadership sometimes forgets to communicate - proactive reminders welcome
    - “Remind us when we forget to tell you”

### Pennsylvania Staffing Resolution
- Shalom Agbanda accepted outreach specialist position in Pennsylvania
    - Applied, interviewed, and accepted offer
    - Will be joined by Eric Jorgensen (also just accepted position)
    - Pennsylvania now fully staffed after previous turnover and vacancy issues
- Transition support structure:
    - Working with Shalom, Raz (current manager), and Tony
    - Meeting needs of both business and Shalom’s family during move
    - Raz described as “incredible” manager who has worn multiple hats
    - Strong management situation for incoming team members
- Performance expectations:
    - Budget target of 4 for PAOS (Pennsylvania team)
    - Goal to “blow that thing out of the water”
    - Confidence in getting Pennsylvania “back on track” after turnover period

### Broker Support Call Routing System
- Current IVR routing sequence for broker support calls:
    - David (primary contact)
    - Mark (secondary, until fully trained on adapter)
    - Inside sales team (round robin, whoever available)
    - Voicemail (final option)
- Time zone coverage:
    - David: West Coast coverage
    - Mark: East Coast coverage
    - Ensures broker support across business hours
- Call handling best practices:
    - Document detailed notes for any unanswered calls
    - Make clean internal handoffs to David or Mark
    - Never guess on answers - be honest about uncertainty
    - Standard response: “Not sure, I’m going to get you the answer”
    - Critical with broker partners due to relationship importance
- Common broker inquiry types:
    - System technical issues (glitchy, funky behavior)
    - Lead status requests (“what’s the status of my lead”)
- Team chat documentation process:
    - Use main inside sales team chat (not private channels)
    - Include Mark in conversations for FAQ development
    - Consolidate questions for systematic FAQ creation
    - Essential for building broker support knowledge base

### Performance Metrics & Team Recognition
- Current SQL performance tracking:
    - Pacing at 118% of SQL goal (significantly above target)
    - Started month slightly under daily average needed
    - 6 out of last 7 days “freaking killed it” and exceeded targets
- Enrollment progression:
    - 25 enrollments currently (up from 22 earlier in call)
    - Organization increased by 7 during meeting
    - Way ahead of last month’s pace at same point
    - Last month required “massive rush” final few days to reach 67 total
- Market share metrics:
    - Currently 28-29% of organization’s total business
    - Target: maintain around 30% of organizational business
    - Need to deliver 10% minimum, but performing well above
- Team motivation and career development philosophy:
    - Glenn and leadership committed to helping team members reach career goals
    - Examples: Shalom’s promotion, David’s role expansion
    - Philosophy: “get you where you want to go, not where someone else says doors are open”
    - Goal for team to “walk through doors you want to go through”
    - Winning together as byproduct of individual growth
    - Statement maintained since inside sales started over 2 years ago

### Action Items & Next Steps
- Mark: Continue developing documentation and FAQ materials with David’s input
- David: Begin ALF lead processing in Colorado, maintain regular queue participation
- Sandra Brownell’s team: Complete Colorado resource documentation, expand to other states
- Glenn: Finalize presumptive close scripting for broker leads
- Team: Document unknown broker questions in main inside sales team chat for FAQ development
- Leadership: Coordinate Shalom’s transition to Pennsylvania with family considerations
- All team members: Use proper terminology (applicants/contact center) in broker interactions
- Inside sales team: Direct brokers without applications to submit through portal for commission tracking

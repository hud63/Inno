Org chart with explicit call center vs. field distinctions

- Revenue/Sales Operations (central)
    
    - You — Sales Enablement (build playbook; train Field, Enrollment, and support Broker channel)
        
    - Glenn — Director of Sales Ops; directly manages the Contact Center (Inside Sales)
        
        - Contact Center (Inside Sales) — CLEARLY SEPARATE FROM FIELD
            - Role title: Assessment Specialists (aka Inside Sales, Call Center)
            - Size: ~10 reps
            - Core responsibilities:
                - Handle inbound/outbound from digital and broker leads
                - Qualify leads quickly (target ~2 days from unqualified → qualified)
                - Use Five9 for telephony; recordings and QA routed via Invoka
                - Work off scripts; leverage Power BI/Dynamics views tailored for inside sales
                - Schedule in-home intake with Enrollment Reps once qualified
            - Tech stack (primary):
                - Five9 (click-to-call, call handling)
                - Invoka (call recording, transcription, attribution, QA scoring)
                - Microsoft Dynamics (record/timeline; activities logged via Five9 add-in)
                - Power BI dashboards (lead/enrollment views)
            - Management/enablement touchpoints:
                - Glenn provides day-to-day leadership
                - You support with scripts, QA insights, enablement, and playbook updates
            - Lead sources they handle:
                - Digital marketing leads (~3,300/month across last 3 months)
                - Broker/FMO “applications” (broker-submitted leads; use more assumptive-close scripting)
            - Performance notes:
                - Competitive space; caregiver-initiated leads convert ~3x better than senior self-submissions
                - Heavily outbound follow-up; yesterday had ~26 qualified leads in a day (near all-time high)
    - Allen — part of the tools/process “tool team” with you and Glenn (QA, transcription/Copilot initiatives)
        
    - Sherry — Broker/FMO relationships; stands up broker channel (external partners feed leads primarily to Contact Center)
        
- Field Sales Organization (distinct from Contact Center)
    
    - Regional Sales Directors (RSDs) — manage Outreach Specialists (field reps)
        - Outreach Specialists (OS) — ~40 field reps; examples: Linda, Alejandro, Josh, Alex
            - Prospect in the field via referral sources (senior centers, hospitals, community orgs, APS, food banks, ALFs/NFs-short-stay, etc.)
            - Enter self-generated leads into Dynamics and manage their own pipeline
            - Current gap: slow qualification (~5 days vs. 2 days in Contact Center) and poor pipeline hygiene (avg “closed” age 415 days; many stale leads)
            - Immediate initiative: train top 10–20 on new Power BI participant leads pipeline dashboard; clean stale leads
    - Enrollment Managers — manage Enrollment Reps
        - Enrollment Reps — conduct in-home intake (~2 hours), coordinate approvals:
            - Financial/Medicaid (EFD), Functional/LOC (nursing assessment), HSD (internal committee)
            - Average intake-to-benefits ~61 days; fastest 1–2 weeks if LTSS Medicaid already in place
- Clinical/Eligibility/Internal Review
    
    - Nursing Team — performs LOC assessments
    - HSD Committee — Health & Safety Determination (ensure “not too sick” for safe home care)
    - EFD Team (Eligibility & Financial Determination) — Medicaid/LTSS acquisition or conversion
- Marketing and External
    
    - Gina — Marketing lead managing digital spend and Rise Media

Key distinction summary

- Contact Center (Inside Sales/Assessment Specialists, managed by Glenn):
    - Centralized, phone-based, script-driven, high-velocity qualification from digital and broker leads, heavy use of Five9/Invoka, faster cycle (~2 days to qualify).
- Field (OS and Enrollment Reps, managed by RSDs/Enrollment Managers):
    - Decentralized, in-person prospecting and in-home intake, OS self-generate and must manage pipelines in Dynamics/Power BI, slower qualification (~5 days), significant pipeline hygiene issues; Enrollment Reps handle intake and approvals leading to enrollment.

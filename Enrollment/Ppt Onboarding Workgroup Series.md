# Ppt Onboarding Workgroup Series

Wed, 08 Oct 25

### Service Recovery Pilot Update

- Kristen followed up with Naomi and Nigel after October 1 deadline missed
    
    - No inputs recorded despite extensive pre-launch and post-launch touchpoints
        
    - Both confirmed they haven’t launched the pilot at all
        
    - During call, Naomi manning front desk while both putting out fires
        
- Center director feedback on capacity constraints:
    
    - Working 12-hour days with no available time
        
    - Participant emergencies requiring immediate attention
        
    - Employee issues needing focus and resolution
        
    - “No excuse - too busy, can’t get to it”
        
- Service recovery workflow challenges identified:
    
    - Root cause analysis to identify early disenrollment risk factors
        
    - Create monthly shortlist of at-risk new participants
        
    - Weekly IDT rounds to discuss identified participants
        
    - Standardized outreach and intervention protocols
        
    - Multi-step process feels cumbersome without delegation options
        
- No delegation possible according to both sites
    
    - “No one in center we could ask to do this kind of work”
        
    - Requires center director involvement throughout process
        

### Current Pilot Implementation Status

- First 30 days onboarding pilot: Only successful launch
    
    - Both Naomi and Nigel report strong traction and team buy-in
        
    - Able to delegate portions to teammates effectively
        
    - Created better participant handoffs and team synchronicity
        
    - “Raving reviews” - where they “put all their eggs in that basket”
        
- Service recovery pilot: Complete standstill
    
    - Zero progress on any components
        
    - Too resource-intensive for current CD bandwidth
        
- Pre-enrollment pilot: Minimal progress
    
    - Orientation booklets distributed by Naomi
        
    - New forms incorporated by Christine into folders
        
    - No systematic implementation beyond materials
        

### Operational Capacity and Delegation Issues

- Center director workload assessment:
    
    - Both sites report inability to launch all three pilots simultaneously
        
    - Resource problem rather than capability or interest issue
        
    - CDs interested in service recovery work but lack time
        
- Delegation challenges highlighted by operations perspective:
    
    - Naomi specifically cited as overwhelmed, taking on every detail
        
    - Not trusting staff members to provide support
        
    - Need for CD education on delegation and staff trust-building
        
    - “Cannot hold onto every single detail and expect to thrive”
        

### Process Modification Proposals Under Discussion

- Staggered pilot launch timeline:
    
    - Both sites recommend 2-month gaps between pilot launches
        
    - Allow stabilization period for each initiative before adding next
        
    - Acknowledge poor planning assumption about simultaneous launches
        
- Service recovery simplification options from Edgar:
    
    - Crop out parts of process to streamline workflow
        
    - Focus on intervention portion rather than full data gathering
        
    - “However you come up with shortlist, let’s standardize approach”
        
- Integration with existing processes (Miranda’s suggestion):
    
    - Leverage 30-day onboarding touchpoints for early warning detection
        
    - Connect existing grievance processes to service recovery actions
        
    - Use Salesforce grievance data for participants under 30 days
        
    - Build standardized RCA process from existing center workflows
        

### Leadership Response and Path Forward

- Acknowledgment of planning oversight:
    
    - “Poor planning to assume center directors could launch all three pilots at one time”
        
    - Need to reassess resource allocation and expectations
        
- Current development initiatives:
    
    - Jonathan Taylor creating dashboard for leading/lagging measures
        
    - Disenrollment tracking for transparency
        
    - Not ready for presentation or feedback yet
        
- Dr. Learned’s proposal for pilot evaluation:
    
    - Survey participants at pilot sites vs non-pilot sites
        
    - Assess pilot success through participant experience comparison
        

### Action Items

- Steve, Megan, and presenter will discuss pilot modifications offline
    
- Include Kristen and Edgar in service recovery initiative redesign meeting
    
- Separate discussion with Dr. Learned on pilot vs non-pilot site participant surveys
    
- Finance partners meeting scheduled to review new value capture approach
    
- Group update expected next week on revised path forward

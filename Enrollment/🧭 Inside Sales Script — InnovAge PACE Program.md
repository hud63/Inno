## 🧓 ESTABLISH NURSING HOME LEVEL OF CARE

> To help get you pre-qualified for PACE, we need to identify daily activities that may have become more challenging over time.  
> The **State of [STATE]** requires at least **[STATE MIN]** for enrollment, and we’ll need to identify **[STATE #]** now to pre-qualify you.  
> Please think about a _tough day_ when sharing — every detail helps us help you.

## 📅 LOCK IN THE INTAKE

> _(If speaking with a PPT, ask them to write this down.)_

**Script:**

> Our last step is to schedule your local PACE specialist to meet with you and start the enrollment process with an intake meeting.  
> It can take up to 60 days to get fully enrolled, so you’ll have time to learn more before making any final decisions.  
> Here are two options: **[Option 1]** or **[Option 2]**. Which works best for you?

**Confirmation:**

> Great! You’re all set to meet with **[ER Name]** on **[Date]** at **[Time]**.  
> They’ll come to your home to start the process — about 1.5 hours.  
> You’ll receive a call beforehand for introductions.

**During the intake:**

- [ER Name] will request financial documents required by your state.
    
- They’ll also ask for a **medication list** and learn about your care needs.
    
- Ask: _Do you have any questions about that?_
    

**Preparation Checklist:**

1. Gather all IDs — State, SSN, Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance cards.
    
2. Ensure you’re available at the scheduled date/time.
    
3. Make your home safe — secure pets and firearms.
    

**Wrap-up:**

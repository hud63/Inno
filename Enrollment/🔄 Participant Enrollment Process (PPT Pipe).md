### Participant Pipeline (FS)

This section describes the step-by-step process a potential participant goes through, from being an initial lead to becoming an active, enrolled participant.

**1. Lead Generation Sources**  
Leads are generated from several key areas:

- **Sales Generated Leads:** Leads brought in directly by the sales team.
    
- **Digital Marketing:** Online campaigns through platforms like Google, AdWords, Facebook, Nextdoor, and Yelp.
    
- **Organic Web Traffic:** Visitors coming to the [www.Innovage.com](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Innovage.com) website and filling out forms or sending emails.
    
- **Awareness Partner Leads:** Referrals from partner organizations such as SelectQuote, A Place for Mom, Care Patrol, Caring.com, and Seniorly.
    

**2. Funnel Stage 1: Lead to Opportunity**  
This funnel tracks a potential participant from initial contact until they become a qualified sales opportunity.

1. **New:** A new lead has entered the system.
    
2. **Attempted:** An attempt has been made to contact the lead.
    
3. **Contacted:** Communication has been established with the lead.
    
4. **Qualified:** The lead has been vetted and is considered a "Sales Qualified" prospect. This triggers the "Native Lead Conversion Process" to move them to the next stage.
    

**3. Funnel Stage 2: Opportunity to Active Participant**  
This funnel tracks the journey from a qualified opportunity to full enrollment.

1. **Qualified:** The individual is a qualified opportunity.
    
2. **Committed:** The individual has committed to moving forward.
    
3. **One Approved:** The first of three necessary approvals is complete.
    
4. **Two Approved:** The second of three approvals is complete.
    
5. **Three Approved:** All three approvals are complete.
    
6. **Closed Won:** The individual is officially enrolled and becomes an **Active Participant**.
    

**4. Lead and Opportunity Statuses**  
Throughout the pipeline, if a lead or opportunity does not progress, they can be assigned one of the following statuses:

- **Closed Lost (Subcategory: Unqualified):** The lead or opportunity is not a good fit.
    
- **Closed Lost (Subcategory: Recycle):** The lead or opportunity is not ready now but may be a candidate in the future. These contacts may be added back into a marketing automation campaign for future nurturing.

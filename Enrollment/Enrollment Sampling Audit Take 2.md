# Enrollment Sampling Audit Take 2

Tue, 07 Oct 25

### Team Introductions

- Mark Stoweled: New hire (started yesterday), supporting Anthony across RevOps and Sales Enablement; based in Deerfield Beach, FL
    
- Priya: Manager on Operational Excellence (OpEx) under Matt Kidwell
    
- Megan: Director on OpEx; based in Southern California
    
- Shadi: VP of Sales (~7 years tenure); partners cross-functionally to streamline enrollment, standardize process, and improve enrollment experience nationally
    
- Note: “Mark” references during the call often referred to Mark Learned (not Mark Newagemedia)
    

### Purpose & Context

- Cross-functional effort (Sales, OpEx, Center Ops/Clinical) to improve onboarding effectiveness and reduce post-enrollment friction
    
- Aim: define the minimum essential “day one” info vs. broader HSD/first-visit data; shrink required fields to improve completion quality
    
- Current CRM has a single large HSD free-text field plus many discrete fields; duplicative entry and low usability
    

### Current Enrollment Form Issues

- Expansion problem: ~14 bullets from Dr. Silversmith/Gabe expanded into 77+ discrete fields on the page layout
    
    - Examples of multi-field breakouts: ADLs (12 items x 2 fields each), suicide history/comments, alcohol use/comments, upcoming procedures, surgery history, SNF/rehab, provider changes, home support, pharmacy, specialists, PCP, shortness of breath, etc.
        
    - Burden: unrealistic to complete 77 fields during 90–120 minute in-person intakes; quality suffers
        
- HSD free-text field
    
    - Duplicates info captured elsewhere; spans multiple topics; used by intake, nurses, and providers at different times
        
    - Not scoreable/searchable; hampers reporting and quality checks
        
- Required vs optional ambiguity
    
    - Not all fields are actually required; some show blank despite “required” expectations
        
    - Need to clarify true required set and remove “fluff”/near-duplicate fields
        

### Colorado Baseline Model (Reference)

- Susan’s monthly “day one needs” report used successfully in Colorado for years; originally shaped with Dr. Silversmith
    
- Serves day-one onboarding, not full first-visit clinical history or HSD risk calculation
    
- Plan: obtain latest Colorado template from Susan and mirror as baseline, adding only a small number of truly missing items if agreed
    

### Field Classification & Scoring Strategy

- Four buckets to reduce confusion:
    
    - Intake information
        
    - HSD (Health Status Determination) info
        
    - Day one onboarding requirements (primary focus of this effort)
        
    - First-visit clinical details (nice-to-have; accessible by drilling into CRM)
        
- Day one fields should inform HSD decisions but are not a comprehensive risk score
    
- Proposed review mechanics for the audit sample (export to Excel/SharePoint):
    
    - Columns: Review status (Not Started, Completed, Action Needed), Completeness score (1=incomplete, 2=some fields missing, 3=complete), Data validation list for status
        
    - Track which of the 77 fields were populated vs. missing to quantify burden and completion
        

### Process & Collaboration Gaps

- Sales completion rates low due to volume/UX; operators stopped using data due to inconsistent quality
    
- Training gaps between operators and sales; mixed signals about whether to rely on intake vs. nurse notes
    
- Participant burden from repeated questioning by multiple teams; need handoffs so nurses can confirm rather than fully re-ask
    
- Communication improvements needed between enrollment reps and nurses to set up assessments
    

### Decisions/Agreements

- Show the 77-field reality to Gabe/Kristen/Dr. Silversmith to drive pruning
    
- Use Colorado list as the “day one” baseline; separate “first visit” and “HSD risk” as different templates/outputs if needed
    
- Limit free-text; favor discrete fields and small, well-defined picklists; combine overlapping items where possible
    

### Next Steps & Owners

- Tony
    
    - Export the enrollment dataset to Excel; stage in SharePoint; add review/completeness columns and validation
        
    - Schedule working session with Gabe, Kristen, and Dr. Silversmith (optional: Megan, Mark Learned) to bucket fields: Day One vs HSD vs Risk vs First Visit
        
    - Retrieve and circulate Susan’s Colorado template; confirm any gaps vs. onboarding needs
        
- Team (OpEx + Sales)
    
    - Score a sample (500 records if feasible) for completion and note issues
        
    - Propose a pared-down required field list focused on day one
        
    - Define separate templates if day one vs first visit vs HSD differ
        
- Longer-term
    
    - Stand up a separate clinical risk scoring initiative (post-onboarding)
        
    - Update CRM design to reduce duplication and improve usability; tighten required-field logic
        
    - Reinforce training and cross-team workflow to prevent re-asking questions and improve data use

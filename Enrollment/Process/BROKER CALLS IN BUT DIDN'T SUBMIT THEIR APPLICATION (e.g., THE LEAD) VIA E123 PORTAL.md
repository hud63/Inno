How to handle?

If calls come in from brokers that have NOT submitted their "application" (this is a lead to us, but let's call it an application on the phone)... 

Then we must request that the broker submits via the e123 portal. 

Simply wait on the call while the broker completes the application/lead and then perform the discovery from there. 

When the broker submits via e123, then the referral source info and category are automatically inserted. There is a referral source account and contact created too.

Why this way?

The application/lead must be submitted via e123 portal so that the commissions can be paid out to both brokers and their FMO (this is the company under which they ultimately report). 

If this step is skipped, then there is quite a bit of manual work required to fix the challenge.

### Meeting Setup & Technical Issues

- Invited wrong Gabe initially (Gabe Townsend vs correct participant)
    
- Several participants joined late due to calendar confusion
    
- Meeting recorded automatically with new transcription feature
    
- Discussed Copilot integration limitations - limited licenses available
    

### HSD Field Reduction Project Overview

- Current system has 90+ overlapping fields for certifications
    
- Susan currently creates single free-text field combining all information
    
- Goal: streamline to essential fields while maintaining clinical accuracy
    
- Need to balance three requirements:
    
    - Input information for HSD preparation
        
    - Output information for day-one onboarding needs
        
    - Clinical scorecard for first-month assessments
        

### Field Categories & Recommendations

- ADL fields: convert from free-text to picklist format
    
    - Options: independent, needs cue, needs help, dependent, unable
        
    - Question whether ADLs needed for day-one priorities
        
- Transport-related fields: consolidate multiple fields into single field
    
- Housing fields: group environmental hazard, emergency egress, housing expectations
    
- Specialist physician details: likely not day-one priority
    

### Day-One Priority Needs Discussion

- Essential immediate needs identified:
    
    - DME requirements and oxygen needs
        
    - Medication supply (7-day supply priorities)
        
    - Dialysis scheduling
        
    - Recent hospice discharge (within 30 days)
        
    - Recent home care services (within 30 days)
        
    - Controlled substances on medication list
        
    - Housing status (ALF vs other)
        
- Borderline items requiring further review:
    
    - ER/inpatient visits in last 6 months (high utilizer identification)
        
    - Behavioral health stability concerns
        
    - Decision-making capacity/POA information
        

### Clinical Score Integration

- Develop risk score with contributing factors display
    
- Separate acute issues/priority needs into free-text field
    
- Examples of acute concerns: active SI, instability requiring immediate team awareness
    
- Clinical scorecard useful for first assessments, not necessarily day-one handoff

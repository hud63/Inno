# Bonus Plan Deep Dive

Tue, 07 Oct 25

### Bonus Plan Overview & Timing

- Monthly, cyclical structure tied to enrollment effective dates (e.g., 08/01, 09/01, etc.)
    
- Three milestones each cycle:
    
    - Bonus letter (beginning of the preceding month): communicates individual/team targets, per‑enrollment rate table by tier, and definitions (e.g., GE = Gross Enrollment)
        
    - Enrollment effective date (1st of the month): prior month’s selling activity converts to active enrollments
        
    - Statement & payment (last paycheck of the subsequent month, usually week 3, sometimes week 4): statement mirrors the letter but with actuals filled in; payout processes via payroll
        
- Timing examples:
    
    - October selling → 11/01 enrollments → paid on last November paycheck
        
    - July selling → 08/01 enrollments → paid on last August paycheck
        
- Ongoing monthly overlap; each month’s work flows into the next month’s payout
    
- Letters show tiered per‑enrollment rates; outperform = higher per‑unit, underperform = lower per‑unit
    

### Performance Tiers & Payouts

- Base construct: Monthly target translates to a per‑enrollment rate table; total monthly potential at “on‑budget” performance is $22.50 (example shown in training docs)
    
- Bronze (100% of target): example showed ~$3.21 per enrollment, totaling ~$22.50 when exactly at target
    
- Silver Plus: 125% performance level; higher per‑enrollment rate than Bronze
    
- Gold: 150% of Bronze rate (i.e., Bronze per‑unit grossed up by 50%)
    
- Platinum: 200% of Bronze rate (double Bronze per‑unit); newly cemented tier and pays materially more when exceeded
    
- Uncapped: No ceiling on earnings; top performers routinely reach $8k–$10k+ monthly
    
- Rationale for steep steps: Small integer volumes per rep and ~250 enrollments/month enterprise‑wide make each incremental enrollment significant; thus tiers jump sharply near threshold (e.g., at 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%)
    

### Target Structure & Calculations

- Individual targets typically 6–8 enrollments per month (Colorado often in the 6–8 “sweet spot”)
    
- Relief: 10% “relief” is taken off the top of the bonus‑group budget before dividing among FTEs
    
    - Example: Group budget 12 → relief to ~11 → 2 OSs → 11 ÷ 2 = 5.5 (rounds to 6 in practice)
        
- Division by FTE: Budgets are split evenly across full‑time employees in the bonus group; adding an FTE reduces each individual’s target and increases the per‑unit rate
    
- Per‑enrollment rate is inversely related to target size
    
    - Higher target → lower per‑unit rate; lower target → higher per‑unit rate
        
- “On‑budget” monthly potential aligns to ~$22.50 regardless of target size; only the per‑unit rate flexes to keep the on‑budget total consistent
    
- Calculator: A locked Excel calculator lets reps key in budget, FTE count, and actuals to see exact payouts across tiers
    

### New Hire Provisions

- Ramp guarantee: $500 per enrollment for the first two full bonus periods after start date (e.g., start in September → applies to 11/01 and 12/01 cycles)
    
- Applies regardless of targets or team performance; intended to ensure early earnings while building call points/referral sources
    
- Admin logic: RevOps compares guaranteed math vs. standard plan math and pays the higher of the two to “keep you whole”
    
- Edge cases: If a new hire massively overperforms (e.g., 8 on a 6), standard plan math may exceed the guarantee; RevOps will apply the favorable outcome
    

### Plan Changes & Updates

- Individual vs. team: Team gating removed; payouts now determined by individual performance only (no Bronze cap due to team miss)
    
- Minimum threshold: Payouts require ≥80% of individual target (previously some scenarios paid starting with the 2nd enrollment if team hit budget)
    
- Platinum tier: Newly cemented; pays 200% of Bronze per‑unit
    
- Fast Start and Rockstar: Time‑based accelerators (Fast Start +$250 for early‑month signings; Rockstar +$500 for staying ahead in weeks 3/4) are slated to sunset
    
- New annual incentives (sneak peek):
    
    - $5,000 for hitting annual target
        
    - $10,000 for two consecutive years
        
    - $15,000 for three consecutive years (designed to reward consistency; “streaks”)
        
- Inside Track: Extra $100 per Inside Sales enrollment applies only in FY’25; slated to end afterward

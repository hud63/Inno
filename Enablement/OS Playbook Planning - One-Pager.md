# Outreach Specialist Sales Playbook Development Plan
**Prepared by:** Mark Newagemedia
**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Purpose:** Planning document for creating OS sales playbook from scratch based on field agent discussions

## Key Findings from OS Agent Discussions

### Current State Challenges
- **No Structured Onboarding**: New OS agents receive virtual training only with no shadowing opportunities, requiring complete self-directed learning
- **Lead Generation Decline**: Continuous drop in lead volume since Inside Sales expansion; OS agents now rely heavily on self-generated community relationships
- **Technology Gap**: Critical inefficiency in field-to-CRM workflow—agents use pen/paper notes, then manually enter data later, risking information loss
- **Pipeline Hygiene Issues**: Average "closed" lead age of 415 days; slow qualification process (~5 days vs. 2 days for Contact Center)

### Success Factors Identified
- **Relationship Building**: Regular in-services (1-2x annually) at key accounts (Adult Protective Services, senior centers, hospitals)
- **Personalized Marketing**: New brochure initiative (3,000+ distributed) with personal contact info driving direct calls
- **Persistence & Initiative**: Top performers self-establish weekly check-ins with leadership and proactively seek peer mentorship
- **Community Presence**: Continuous re-marketing to same accounts due to high staff turnover at referral sources

## Recommended Playbook Structure

### 1. **Foundation Module** (Week 1-2)
- PACE/LIFE program fundamentals & value proposition
- Medicare/Medicaid dual-eligible basics
- Compliance & marketing guidelines
- CRM systems training (Insights/Dynamics, Power BI dashboards)

### 2. **Field Methodology** (Week 3-4)
- Community account identification & prioritization
- Referral source relationship building (APS, hospitals, ALFs, senior centers)
- First-level scripting framework (adapted from existing 26-tab script resource)
- Personalized marketing material usage

### 3. **Lead Management & Pipeline Hygiene** (Ongoing)
- Self-generated lead capture & qualification process
- Daily/weekly pipeline maintenance protocols
- Stale lead cleanup procedures
- Qualification speed targets (reduce from 5 days to 3 days)

### 4. **Objection Handling** (Week 5-6)
- Top 4 closure reasons framework:
  1. PCP resistance → Care coordination value
  2. HMO/MA resistance → All-inclusive care benefits
  3. Home care resistance → Comprehensive support model
  4. Medicaid concerns → Application assistance process

## Critical Technology & Process Needs

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Mobile CRM Solution**: Tablet-based field access (12-13" devices) with connectivity packs for real-time data entry
2. **Voice-to-Text Integration**: Bluetooth-enabled voice recording that auto-populates CRM fields
3. **Power BI Dashboard Training**: New participant leads pipeline dashboard rollout for top 10-20 performers

### Process Improvements
- **Shadowing Program**: Pair new OS agents with experienced reps for 2-week ride-along period
- **Weekly Check-ins**: Mandatory manager touchpoints for first 90 days
- **Peer Network**: Establish cross-regional OS community for best practice sharing

## Next Steps & Immediate Actions

### Phase 1: Discovery & Documentation (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] Complete additional OS agent interviews (2-3 more agents from different regions/tenure levels)
- [ ] Document successful workflows from top performers
- [ ] Audit existing training materials and identify gaps

### Phase 2: Playbook Development (Weeks 5-8)
- [ ] Draft modular playbook content based on recommended structure
- [ ] Adapt existing 26-tab scripting resource into field-friendly format
- [ ] Develop quick reference guides for common objections

### Phase 3: Pilot & Iteration (Weeks 9-12)
- [ ] Pilot playbook with 3-5 new OS hires
- [ ] Test mobile technology solutions (tablet pilot)
- [ ] Gather feedback and refine content

### Phase 4: Rollout (Month 4+)
- [ ] Full deployment with ~40 current OS agents
- [ ] Launch shadowing program infrastructure
- [ ] Establish ongoing training cadence and playbook update process

## Success Metrics to Track
- Time to first qualified lead (new hires)
- Lead qualification speed (target: <3 days)
- Average pipeline age (reduce from 415 days)
- SQL conversion rates from self-generated leads
- New hire retention at 90 days and 1 year

---

**Bottom Line:** Creating an OS playbook from scratch requires addressing the structural gaps in onboarding, technology infrastructure, and pipeline management while codifying the relationship-building and persistence strategies that drive top performer success. The playbook must be practical for field use and supported by enabling technology solutions.

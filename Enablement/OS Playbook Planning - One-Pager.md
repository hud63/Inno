# Outreach Specialist Sales Playbook Development Plan
**Prepared by:** Mark Newagemedia
**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Purpose:** Planning document for creating OS sales playbook from scratch based on field agent discussions

---

## Agent Interviews Conducted

**Three OS agents interviewed representing different tenure, geography, and strategies:**

1. **Michael Martinez** - 3 years tenure, self-taught community builder, promoted to management
2. **Alejandro Ramirez** - Top performer (~1 year), hospital-focused strategy, 13 enrollments/month peak
3. **Jennifer Tremble** - 4 years tenure, relationship-focused, consistent performer with Adult Services

---

## Universal Themes: What All Three Said

### 1. **Training is Non-Existent**
- No structured onboarding beyond virtual calls with Glen/Alan
- No shadowing opportunities ("I had to build my own path from scratch" - Michael)
- No role-play scenarios or ongoing skill development
- "Training is basically non-existent. No role plays. No structured onboarding." - Alejandro
- Top performers are self-starters who figure it out independently

### 2. **Technology is Inadequate for Field Work**
- All three mentioned mobile technology gaps
- Michael: Uses pen/paper, then manually enters data later ("old school")
- Jennifer: "Only has trifold brochure on phone," wants iPad
- Alejandro: CRM lacks account-level referral tracking and performance analytics
- Real-time field data capture is impossible with current tools

### 3. **Lead Follow-Up is Critical**
- "A slip and fall can change someone's mind in a heartbeat" - Jennifer (checks leads 2x/day)
- Pipeline hygiene issues across organization (415-day average closed lead age)
- 45-day enrollment period creates attrition risk (seniors die, move, change minds)

### 4. **Success Requires Self-Initiative**
- Michael: Proactively established weekly check-ins with leadership for months
- Alejandro: "Top performers... are self-starters. We built our own playbooks."
- Jennifer: Emphasizes being "a resource" and building relationships over time
- Current model only works for highly driven individuals

## Divergent Strategies: Multiple Paths to Success

### Hospital-Focused Strategy (Alejandro)
- **Target:** Hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, case managers, doctors
- **Results:** 3-4 solid weekly referrals, 4-13 enrollments/month range
- **Philosophy:** Seniors frequent medical facilities most as they age
- **Skills Required:** Hospital rounding, case manager relationships, doctor engagement
- **Evidence:** Top Florida performers (Alejandro, Oya) both use this approach

### Community Relationship Strategy (Michael)
- **Target:** Adult Protective Services, senior centers, community organizations
- **Tactics:** Educational in-services 1-2x annually, personalized brochure distribution (3,000+)
- **Challenge:** High staff turnover requires "remarketing everything I've already marketed"
- **Results:** Sustainable but requires continuous re-education efforts

### Relationship-First Strategy (Jennifer)
- **Focus:** Building relationships with adult services, providing updates on enrollees
- **Environment Change:** Used to sign 5 people at single event, now requires more calls/visits
- **Observation:** Seniors more wary of scams, requiring trust-building approach
- **Key Advice:** "Listen to Glen, have a good mix of referrals, be a resource, do tours"

## Critical Technology & Tool Gaps

### Mobile Field Access (All Three)
- **Michael:** Wants tablets (12-13") with Verizon connectivity packs for vehicle-based work
- **Jennifer:** Needs iPad with more literature readily available
- **Alejandro:** Needs enhanced CRM account management capabilities

### Voice-to-Text Integration (Michael)
- Bluetooth earpiece for real-time voice recording
- Auto-populate CRM fields upon return to office
- Reduce dual-entry workflow (pen/paper → computer)

### CRM Analytics Deficiencies (Alejandro)
- Cannot view all referrals from single account/facility
- Limited account performance analytics
- Inadequate data for business management decisions
- Previous employer (hospice) had superior capabilities

### Module 3: Lead Management & Objection Handling (Week 3-4)
- Leverage existing 26-tab scripting resource (adapted for field use)
- Top 4 closure reasons framework:
  1. PCP resistance → Care coordination value
  2. HMO/MA resistance → All-inclusive care benefits
  3. Home care resistance → Comprehensive support model
  4. Medicaid concerns → Application assistance process
- Pipeline hygiene protocols (reduce from 5 days to 3 days qualification)

- Regional success story breakdowns

---

## Hiring Protocol Recommendations (Alejandro)

### Current Problem
- Bachelor's degree mandatory, focus on credentials over behavioral fit
- "Poor initial hiring + inadequate training = predictable failures"
- High Florida turnover requiring ongoing terminations

### Recommended Criteria
- **Prioritize:** Drive, ambition, money-motivation, numbers focus
- **De-emphasize:** Educational credentials alone
- **Target:** "InnovAge DNA" - self-starters who teach themselves systems
- **Screen for:** Focus, intelligence, work efficiency, relationship-building ability

---

## Implementation Plan

**Approach:** Build playbook by capturing real training and role-play sessions, not writing from scratch.

### Content Capture Sources

**1. Pennsylvania Training Recordings**
- Record Glen's onboarding sessions with new Pennsylvania hires (Eric & Shalom)
- Capture foundation training, territory setup, field prep, and coaching sessions
- Transcribe and extract playbook content from Glen's live training

**2. Florida On-Site Role-Play Sessions**
- Visit Florida to record Alejandro's hospital strategy in action
- Conduct role-play scenarios: Case Manager, Doctor, Social Worker, Senior/Family objection handling
- Alejandro plays OS, partner OS plays various personas
- Transcribe sessions and build role-play training modules from recordings

---

## Success Metrics to Track

**Speed Metrics:**
- Time to first qualified lead (new hires): target <30 days
- Lead qualification speed: reduce from 5 days to <3 days
- Average pipeline age: reduce from 415 days to <90 days

**Performance Metrics:**
- New hire enrollment rate: Month 1 (1+), Month 2 (2+), Month 3 (4+)
- Monthly enrollment range by strategy: Hospital (6-13), Community (4-8), Hybrid (4-6)
- Weekly referral generation: 3-4 minimum

**Retention Metrics:**
- New hire retention at 90 days: target >80%
- New hire retention at 1 year: target >70%
- Voluntary turnover reduction: track quarterly

**Training ROI:**
- % of reps hitting enrollment targets post-training vs. pre-training
- Time to productivity (qualified leads → enrollments)

---

## Key Stakeholder Engagement

**Alejandro Ramirez** - Willing to serve as training consultant, passionate about developing teams, available for curriculum collaboration

**Michael Martinez** - Recently promoted to management, can provide manager perspective on OS needs, committed to CRM improvement testing

**Jennifer Tremble** - 4-year veteran with relationship expertise, can mentor on adult services strategy

**Glen** - Regional manager, well-respected by all three agents, key stakeholder for training approval and rollout

---

## Bottom Line

**Three completely different OS agents revealed the same core problem: lack of structured training creates a "self-starter only" environment that isn't scalable.**

The playbook must:
1. Provide **multiple proven go-to-market strategies** (hospital, community, relationship-focused) rather than one-size-fits-all
2. Include **robust role-play scenarios** to build confidence before field deployment
3. Be supported by **mobile technology** that enables real-time field work
4. Feature **ongoing monthly training** to sustain skill development
5. Support **revised hiring protocols** that screen for drive and behavioral fit over credentials alone

**The opportunity:** Top performers are already achieving 8-13 enrollments/month using self-taught strategies. Codifying and scaling these approaches through a structured playbook can elevate the entire ~40-person OS team and dramatically improve new hire success rates.

"When I joined, I was told to go learn from the Tampa team. But I got there and ended up training them.

I’ve opened two centers, built marketing strategies, and I manage more hospitals than anyone else in Florida. Why? Because I know how to round a hospital. I know how to talk to case managers and doctors. That’s not being taught here — and it needs to be.

Training is basically non-existent. No role plays. No structured onboarding. The top performers in this company — myself, Oya, Alex — we’re self-starters. We built our own playbooks.

But that’s not scalable. If you want more high performers, you need better hiring protocols, ongoing training, and real coaching. I’d love to be part of that. I want to train teams. I want to see them succeed."

### Alejandro’s Background & Role

- Background & Hiring Process
    
    - Started January 2024, recruited from hospice industry in December 2023
        
    - Initially thought recruitment was scam, had no knowledge of PACE/Innovage
        
    - Single 45-minute panel interview with Shadi Rob (former Chief of Sales), Glenn, and ex-manager (all no longer with company)
        
    - Unusual hiring: most candidates go through 2-3 interviews
        
- Territory & Responsibilities
    
    - Hired for Orlando but sent to Tampa first for training
        
    - Discovered Tampa team lacked skills, ended up training them instead
        
    - Helped open both Tampa and Orlando centers
        
    - Developed marketing strategies for both locations
        
    - Currently manages 5 hospitals across Florida (most in state)

    - Typical range: 4-8 monthly enrollments
        
    - Historical average: 5-6 enrollments when accounting for highs/lows
        
    - Current month forecast: 6-8 enrollments (7 confirmed, 1 pending)
        
    - Last month: only 2 due to LOC delays
        
- Compensation Structure
    
    - 6 enrollments: $600 per enrollment
        
    - 7 enrollments: $800 per enrollment
        
    - 8+ enrollments: $1,000 per enrollment (new platinum level)

    - Focus on sustainable, consistent referral sources
        

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Hospital-Focused Approach
    
    - Specializes in calling on hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, doctors
        
    - Only Orlando rep with hospital calling expertise
        
    - Partners with Oya Galari/Galatti in Tampa (best Tampa rep, also hospital-focused)
        
    - Both top Florida performers use hospital strategy
        
- Community vs Medical Facility Strategy
    
    - Company traditionally pushes community events: churches, farmer’s markets, senior expos, pharmacy tables, 55+ communities
        
    - Alejandro’s philosophy: seniors frequent medical facilities most as they age with complex diagnoses
        
    - Believes hospital calling fills funnel faster than multiple community touchpoints
        
- Skill Set Requirements
    
    - Hospital rounding techniques
        
    - Case manager relationship building
        
    - Doctor engagement protocols
        
    - Social worker collaboration
        

### Training Program Gaps

- Current Training Deficiencies
    
    - No structured initial training beyond brief calls with Glenn and Alan
        
    - Example: First day in Tampa building full of Spanish-speaking seniors, no Spanish-speaking reps present
        
    - Learned by memorizing flyer, scheduled 5 intakes with no guidance
        
    - Recent trainee Jose Moreno from Colorado received same minimal 3-day training
        
- Ongoing Education Absence
    
    - No monthly skill development sessions
        
    - No continuous learning programs
        
    - Reps left to figure out complex systems independently
        
- Recommended Training Program
    
    - Monthly POA (Plan of Action) sessions for all reps
        
    - Medicare and Medicare Advantage curriculum
        
    - Role-play scenarios by persona:
        
        - Social workers
            
        - Case managers
            
        - Doctors/physicians
            
        - Church communities
            
    - Structured PowerPoint presentations and classroom instruction
        
    - Internal mistake-making environment before field deployment
        

### Hiring & Personnel Observations

- Current Hiring Requirements
    
    - Bachelor’s degree mandatory for Enrollment Representatives (ERs)
        
    - Bachelor’s degree required for Outreach Specialists (OSs), or equivalent experience

    - Seek money-driven, numbers-focused candidates

    - Target “Innovage DNA” based on behavioral traits
        
- Team Performance Dynamics

**"When I started in the Outreach Specialist role three years ago, there was no playbook—just virtual training and a lot of guessing. No shadowing, no expectations. I had to build my own path from scratch. I reached out to others, set up weekly check-ins with leadership, and slowly pieced together what success looked like. That initiative helped me grow into a management role.**

**The biggest challenge today? Capturing field conversations in real time. After meeting 5–6 contacts in one morning, I still have to handwrite notes and enter them later. If there were a voice-to-text or mobile solution tied into the CRM, that would be a game-changer.**

**Tools matter. Process matters. But what really made the difference for me was having a reason to push through: my family, my professionalism, and my commitment to doing great work—even when the path isn’t clear."**

### Michael’s Background & Start at Innovage

- Started OS role 3 years ago (September 2022 marked his three-year anniversary)
    
- Previous professional background: Social worker by trade with 7 years in sales/marketing
    
    - Most recent role: 5 years as rehab liaison at Encompass Rehab Hospital
        
    - Handled all sales and marketing for the rehabilitation facility
        
    - Healthcare sales/marketing experience but zero PACE program knowledge
        
- Discovery of Innovige opportunity:
    
    - Found role through unexpected recruiter cold call to personal phone
        
    - Received call while walking between accounts during lunch break
        
    - Usually doesn’t answer unknown numbers but decided to pick up
        
    - Describes it as “the best call I’ve ever had” that brought him to current position
        

### Initial Training & Learning Curve

- Complete absence of structured onboarding or mentorship
    
    - No training personnel available when he started
        
    - No opportunity to shadow successful OS representatives
        
    - Had to “pick up the pieces” and learn from mistakes independently
        
- Self-directed learning initiatives taken:
    
    - Completed all available virtual training modules
        
    - Attended monthly training sessions led by Glenn and Tony Horner (first 1.5 years)
        
    - Proactively reached out to Dana Lewis in California for guidance
        
    - Established weekly meetings with Glenn for several months until gaining confidence
        
    - Developed understanding of role expectations through trial and error
        
- Ongoing learning mindset: “Even though I’m in year three, as long as you have an open mind to things, there’s always new stuff you could learn”
    

### Lead Generation Changes & Impact

- Initial period characterized by lead overwhelm:
    
    - Received comprehensive lead flow including all phone call leads and digital leads
        
    - Existing lead generation system already established and functioning
        
    - Volume was unmanageable for single person to handle effectively
        
- Significant operational shift with inside sales implementation:
    
    - Inside sales team took over majority of lead handling
        
    - Most prospects now research online, read reviews, and request information digitally
        
    - These digital inquiries automatically route to inside sales rather than field OS
        
    - Lead volume has “continually dropped” since inside sales expansion
        
- Behavioral shift comparison: “My wife shops mainly online these days rather than go to the mall” - similar pattern with PACE program inquiries
    
- Current lead generation reality:
    
    - Only receives leads when prospects specifically call him directly
        
    - Struggling to maintain consistent lead flow
        
    - Focus shifted to building in-person community accounts
        

### Current Outreach Methods & Tools

- Community relationship building strategy:
    
    - Educational in-services delivered 1-2 times annually at key accounts
        
    - Example: Adult Protective Services receives regular educational presentations
        
    - High staff turnover requires continuous re-education efforts
        
    - “Remarketing everything I’ve already marketed” due to personnel changes
        
- New personalized brochure initiative:
    
    - Recently received new trifold brochures with personalized information capability
        
    - Ordered approximately 3,000 brochures for distribution
        
    - Delivered ~500 brochures to Adult Protective Services in single day
        
    - Encouraging direct calls by providing personal contact information
        
- CRM (Insights) platform evolution:
    
    - Initial resistance: “I was a little bit hesitant to continue to use the CRM because I didn’t feel that it was really user friendly”
        
    - Management perspective shift: Now appreciates tool for tracking team performance and enrollment progress
        
    - Provides visibility into entire enrollment process timeline and participant status
        
    - Critical limitation: Cannot perform real-time data entry during field visits
        
- Current workflow inefficiency:
    
    - Morning example: Visited 5-6 different accounts with multiple conversations
        
    - Must return to computer for follow-up calls and data entry
        
    - Uses “old school” pen and paper method for field notes
        
    - Writes brief reminders to trigger memory for later detailed entry
        
    - Separates field activities from CRM data entry into distinct processes
        

### Technology & Process Improvement Suggestions

- Voice-to-text integration with Bluetooth technology:
    
    - Envisions “old school Bluetooth in the ear” for voice-to-text note taking
        
    - Would enable real-time voice recording that generates text notes
        
    - Could automatically populate CRM fields upon return to computer
        
    - Leverages AI advancement for field productivity improvement
        
- Enhanced mobile technology solutions:
    
    - Current phone inadequate: “I don’t feel comfortable entering anything on my tiny little phone”
        
    - Tablet recommendation based on previous employer success:
        
        - 12-13 inch tablets for comfortable field data entry
            
        - Verizon internet packs for connectivity anywhere
            
        - Enables real-time CRM access and work completion from vehicle
            
        - Previous employer provided this setup with positive results
            
- Smart field population capabilities:
    
    - AI-powered system that makes intelligent guesses about appropriate fields
        
    - Would significantly reduce manual data entry time
        
    - Could streamline dual tracking of lead sources and participant information
        

### Success Factors & Management Promotion

- Recent promotion to management role (timeline not specified but current)
    
- Personal motivation drivers:
    
    - Family financial responsibility as primary motivator
        
    - Professional reputation and standards maintenance
        
    - Commitment to giving 100% effort in any undertaking
        
    - “If I’m not the best, I’m at least giving my very best”
        
- Learning and resilience approach:
    
    - Willingness to learn from failures and mistakes
        
    - Takes initiative to seek help and guidance when needed
        
    - Maintains open mind to continuous improvement opportunities
        
- Upbringing influence: Credits family background and values for work ethic and dedication
    

### Risks/Challenges

    - Continued decline in lead volume since inside sales expansion
        
    - Dependency on prospects making direct contact calls
        
    - Competition with online research and digital inquiry preferences
        
- Operational inefficiencies:
    
    - Time-consuming dual data entry process (field notes then CRM)
        
    - Inability to capture real-time interactions during field visits
        
    - Risk of information loss between field activities and computer entry
        
- Community relationship maintenance:
    
    - High staff turnover requiring constant re-education efforts
        
    - Need for continuous remarketing to same accounts
        
    - Resource intensity of maintaining multiple account relationships

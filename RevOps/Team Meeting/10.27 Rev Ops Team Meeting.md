- Fantasy football season struggles despite high performance
    
    - Missing playoffs in both leagues despite being second highest scorer
        
    - Sitting at 4th and 6th seeds with most points scored against
        
    - Forgot kicker was on bye week, playing with 8 instead of 9 players
        
- Baseball more enjoyable since pitch clock rule changes
    
    - Mark watching more baseball due to improved pace
        
    - Rule changes made games significantly better
        
- Hockey discussion: Mark’s former favorite sport
    
    - Prefers hockey but dislikes rule changes from 2005-2006 era
        
    - Rule changes “ruined the sport” in Mark’s opinion
        
    - Fighting still allowed which others respect
        
    - Live hockey described as most addictive sport experience
        
    - Indiana lacks local hockey presence
        

### Broker Lead Merge Process

- Current challenge: duplicate leads when broker submits existing contact information
    
- Two-part solution proposed by development team:
    
    - Technical fix: automated matching and status updates
        
        - Keep all broker leads in system instead of closing extras
            
        - Auto-detect matches using defined criteria
            
        - Update all matching leads to same status (qualified/disqualified)
            
        - Point all leads to single contact and enrollment record
            
        - Maintains accurate taxonomy for conversion tracking
            
    - Payment structure consideration
        
        - Vince concerned about brokers gaming system
            
        - Risk of multiple brokers submitting same lead for guaranteed $100 payment
            
        - Need policy on paying existing contacts in system
            
- Benefits of new approach:
    
    - Preserves complete lead attribution chain (e.g., Tony Horner from poster, phone call, etc.)
        
    - Enables proper taxonomy analysis showing all touchpoints leading to enrollment
        
    - Mirrors out-of-box CRM functionality for lead conversion
        
- Implementation plan: close duplicate leads to prevent double payment while maintaining data connections
    
- Topic moved to CRM review for further discussion

    - Post-vacation focus: third integration work plus phone taxonomies
        
- Invoka phone call taxonomies requested by Vince
    
    - User taxonomy prioritized over phone call taxonomy

    - Dan has recurring cache-lock issues with button testing
        
- Supplemental contact system overhaul (Dan):
    
    - Critical system discovered using problematic JavaScript approach
        
    - JavaScript only triggered on page navigation, missing many triggers
        
    - Converting 1,000+ lines of JavaScript to cloud flow automation
        
    - More complex than initially expected but good progress made
        
    - New flow will trigger automatically regardless of navigation

    - Email with scheduling link as backup option
        
- Format decision critical for usability:
    
    - Started with Excel template from Glenn (QRST tabs) - unsuitable

    - PowerPoint considered for visual elements and hyperlinks

    - Most views created, waiting for productive account stamps to complete

### New Bonus Plan Structure

- Comprehensive overhaul eliminating multiple existing programs:
    
    - Fast Start, Rock Star, and InsideTrack programs discontinued
        
    - Group bonus dependency removed (individual performance focus)
        
- Platinum tier restructured:
    
    - 175% budget attainment threshold for double payment per enrollment
        
    - Example: hit 175% of 18 enrollments = every enrollment pays double
        
    - Permanent fixture in compensation structure
        
- Tiered performance curves by quota level:
    
    - Reps carrying 9+ individual quota: steeper reward curve after 100%
        
    - Lower thresholds for silver/gold/platinum (150%/130%/115% vs higher baseline)
        
    - Rationale: harder to outperform with larger individual numbers
        
    - Also applies to leaders carrying 60+ quota
        
- Structural changes:
    
    - OS team 10% reduction made permanent
        
    - Participation floor raised from 75% to 80% (targeting low-quota carriers)
        
    - Quarterly payout structure: 25% each quarter vs 10/20/30/40 split
        
- President’s Club “Mount Everest” program:
    
    - Full fiscal year performance requirement
        
    - Tiered rewards: $10k first year, $15k consecutive second, $20k consecutive third
        
    - One-time annual payments for sustained excellence
        
    - Applies to frontline teammates (leadership inclusion unclear, needs clarification)
        
- Regional pilot programs:
    
    - Colorado and San Bernardino: no payment for ALF (Assisted Living Facility) enrollments
        
    - Applies to both outreach specialists and enrollment reps
        
    - Inside sales carved out (no control over placement decisions)
        
    - Different regional challenges: Colorado OSes vs San Bernardino ERs gaming system
        
- San Bernardino team adjustments:
    
    - Reduction from 5 to 4 FTEs (ghost runner situation correction)
        
    - Excluded from 9+ quota enhanced plan due to lower at-risk amount ($6,300 vs $22,500)
        
    - Corporate response prepared for equity complaints
        
- Implementation timeline:
    
    - Target: December 1st enrollments
        
    - Legal approval required this week
        
    - Likely January 1st start if legal review delays
        
- Jill Frank introduction:
    
    - New Colorado Regional Sales Director starting today
        
    - Summer no longer with organization

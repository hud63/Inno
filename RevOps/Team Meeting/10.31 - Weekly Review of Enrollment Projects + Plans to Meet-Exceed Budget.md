Chat with meeting transcript: [https://notes.granola.ai/d/ced6a150-0cde-46e8-8cae-578df9d7ac80](https://notes.granola.ai/d/ced6a150-0cde-46e8-8cae-578df9d7ac80)

Problem: You exceeded enrollment targets but missed disenrollment budget by a wide margin (188 vs 162), driven largely by deaths and some competitive/product issues. The core decision: What actions do you take in the next 1–2 cycles to reduce avoidable disenrollments and protect net census without jeopardizing enrollment momentum?

Major decisions surfaced

- DHCS sensitivity in California: Manage the 6% overage vs manual allotment risk and messaging with DHCS.
- Disenrollment reduction: Which levers to prioritize (options counseling, out-of-catchment leakage, competitive threats like Aetna stipend and True Pace “smaller setting,” financial eligibility/LOMI handling, facility quality initiatives).
- Colorado mix/independence: Whether to intervene now to raise independent-living rate vs focus on raw volume.
- Florida/Tampa Medicaid pending policy: Standardize handling to avoid last-minute enrollment loss.
- Competitive response in PA and CO: Respond to Aetna $300 stipend and True Pace’s smaller-setting positioning.
- Staffing/ops: Rapidly enable Jill in CO to shift mix KPIs and center practices.

Most important problem Contain avoidable disenrollments (non-death) by market-specific countermeasures so net census growth holds. Deaths are exogenous; the avoidable segments (options counseling outcomes, out-of-catchment moves, benefit competition, financial eligibility churn) are actionable and materially impacting budget.

Do you agree? If not, define the problem you want to solve most.

Three decision frameworks to use

- Cost of Delay + Impact Feasibility Matrix: Rank disenrollment levers by ROI and speed to impact.
- OODA Loop (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act): Rapid, iterative response by market with weekly telemetry.
- CSD Matrix (Certainties–Suppositions–Doubts): Separate facts vs hypotheses on why members exit to focus tests.

Chosen framework: Impact–Feasibility (with Cost of Delay overlay) to pick a tight, high-yield action set for the next 30–60 days.

Step-by-step using Impact–Feasibility + Cost of Delay

1. Define target: Cut avoidable disenrollments by 20–30% in 60 days in VA, CO, PA; avoid enrollment slowdowns.
2. Break down avoidable categories from transcript
    - Options counseling exits (VA: Richmond 4 OC; SB expecting more).
    - Out-of-catchment moves/placements (VA multiple centers).
    - Benefit competition: PA Aetna $300 versatile stipend; CO True Pace “smaller setting.”
    - Financial eligibility/Medicaid (FL Tampa pending case; CO SNF financial ineligible; LOMI refusals).
3. Score levers (High/Med/Low) by Impact, Feasibility (2–4 weeks), Cost of Delay (per missed month)
    - Competitive parity offers (PA stipend response: card/benefit mapping + sales scripting): Impact High, Feasibility Med, Cost of Delay High.
    - “Smaller setting” counter-positioning in CO (micro-cohorts, day-center experience tours, caregiver ratio proof): Impact Med–High, Feasibility Med, Cost of Delay Med–High.
    - Options counseling save-playbook (decision aids, 48-hour RN/LCM callback, “try-before-exit” day-center trial): Impact High, Feasibility High, Cost of Delay High.
    - Out-of-catchment retention (pre-move navigation, partner SNF/AL contracts in boundary zones): Impact Med, Feasibility Med, Cost of Delay Med.
    - Medicaid pending/LOMI standard work (scripts, guarantees, deposit alternatives, status-tracking): Impact Med–High, Feasibility High, Cost of Delay High.
    - Facility quality initiative continuation (already in flight): Impact Med, Feasibility High, Cost of Delay Med.
4. Select top 5 actions (highest combined scores)
    - Options counseling save-playbook: Standardize across VA/CA immediately. KPI: save rate from OC ≥50%.
    - Competitive response in PA: Rapid Aetna stipend counter—benefit comparison sheet + targeted “PACE total value” script; if permissible, test a limited utility/food stipend or partner vouchers. KPI: competitive-loss rate ↓50%.
    - CO “smaller setting” counter: Pilot micro-cohort days, smaller group rotations, and “quiet track” tours; arm sales with true average census-per-room visuals and satisfaction data. KPI: loss-to-True Pace ↓50% in 45 days.
    - Medicaid pending/LOMI playbook: Clear payment responsibility script, “bridge” policy (conditional enrollment + financial counseling), proactive status chase. KPI: pending-related fall-offs ↓60%.
    - Out-of-catchment leakage: Fast-track agreements with frequent destination facilities; create “retain-in-network” checklist pre-discharge. KPI: out-of-area disenrollments ↓30%.
5. Owners and timelines
    - Options counseling: VA market leads + central CX—go live in 2 weeks.
    - PA competitive: Katina benefit matrix + sales enablement—one-pager in 1 week; pilot offer in 3–4 weeks (compliance-reviewed).
    - CO setting perception: Jill—2-center pilot in 3 weeks.
    - Medicaid/LOMI: FL + CO + central rev cycle—scripts and SOP in 1 week; training week 2.
    - Out-of-catchment: VA ops + contracting—target top 3 facilities in 30 days.
6. Guardrails
    - Compliance/legal review for any stipend/offer parity.
    - Do not trade enrollment volume for mix in CO without business case; track CLV by segment.
7. Metrics dashboard (weekly)
    - Avoidable disenrollments by cause and market.
    - OC save rate; competitive-loss rate; pending/LOMI drop-offs; out-of-catchment count.
    - Net census growth; CO independent rate vs target; CA DHCS variance risk status.

Concise recommendations

- Implement a standardized Options Counseling save protocol across VA/CA within 2 weeks.
- Launch PA competitive one-pager and script vs Aetna $300 within 1 week; evaluate compliant value-add pilot in 30 days.
- In CO, counter “smaller setting” with micro-cohort experience and new tour design; message caregiver ratios and quieter tracks; measure loss to True Pace.
- Institute a Medicaid pending/LOMI SOP and script in FL/CO; add a “financial bridge” path where allowed.
- Close top out-of-catchment pathways via targeted facility MOUs and pre-discharge retention checklist.
- Manage CA DHCS sensitivity: validate the “100th was pre-cutoff” documentation; align on reporting narrative before the DHCS meeting.

### CRM View Requirements for Medicare Advantage Brokers

- Need replacement for Tony’s broken “Sam’s leads this month” view
    
    - Original view no longer functions despite accurate breakdown display
        
    - Contains persistent display issues (like “Shah Bess” name that won’t delete)
        
    - Was previously shared between Mark, Alex, Ron, and RSDs
        
- New view specifications:
    
    - Default filter: Created date = this month
        
    - Channel/referral source = Medicare Advantage Brokers only (excluding community awareness partners and digital awareness partners)
        
    - Monthly roll-up behavior tracking all leads for specific month regardless of current date
        
    - User ability to change date ranges (past year, specific months) with manual toggle functionality
        
    - Must save filter settings permanently unlike current temporary apply/revert behavior
        
- Alan will build from scratch and push through CRM team for system-wide deployment
    
    - Ensures Sherry won’t need to manually navigate complex filtering
        
    - Provides same access level for all stakeholders (Sherry, Ron, RSDs, etc.)
        
    - Eliminates inconvenience of toggling through multiple referral sources
        

### Portal Integration Issues - E123 System

- 25-27 applications submitted since October showing completely blank enrollment statuses
    
    - Two test applications included in count
        
    - Expected to display “application received” and subsequent status updates
        
    - Applications like John Murray’s from October 7th remain without any status indication
        
- Agent and FMO frustration mounting over lack of visibility
    
    - Portal designed to feed into their commission systems automatically
        
    - Three weeks without status updates affecting broker relationships
        
- Immediate remediation plan:
    
    - Mark and Sherry will export application list containing unique application ID numbers
        
    - Alan coordinating with Cody and Bowie to pull backend enrollment statuses using e123 IDs
        
    - Manual reporting to be delivered today and continued every 1-2 days as interim solution
        
    - Target resolution within one week
        
- System discrepancy: 31 items in CRM pipeline vs 25 showing in portal
    
    - Some applications from old contracts still in CRM pipeline creating complexity
        
    - “Sam pipeline” view available for individual broker status updates showing intake process and next steps information
        

### Historical Data Migration Planning

- Brokers requesting access to legacy enrollments under previous contracts
    
    - Need visibility into existing clients still within coverage age
        
    - Essential for maintaining broker relationships and service continuity
        
- Implementation requires coordination between Alan, Tony, and Mark
    
    - Tony’s involvement critical for defining migration process
        
    - E123 portal has existing capability to upload data from CRM
        
    - Mark needs training on migration procedures
        
- Addresses broker frustration over lack of historical client visibility
    

### Next Steps

- Alan: Begin building new Medicare Advantage broker view this afternoon
    
- Alan: Contact Cody and Bowie today to pull enrollment status report using e123 application IDs
    
- Mark/Sherry: Export current application list with unique ID numbers for immediate manual reporting
    
- Alan: Attach exported data to message thread with Bowie for backend status matching
    
- Team: Schedule three-way meeting with Tony to define historical data migration process and establish ETA
    
- Ongoing: Maintain manual reporting cadence every 1-2 days until automated system restoration

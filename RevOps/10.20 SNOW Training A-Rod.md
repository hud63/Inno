### Context

SNOW training session between Mark and team member reviewing CRM ticket resolution processes, focusing on referral contact setup issues and ServiceNow ticket management workflows.

### CRM Referral Contact Issue - Priority Case

- **Problem Identification**
    
    - Tony requested adding referral source to contact and lead for husband/wife case
        
    - Husband not entered in E123 system, preventing proper commission flow to broker Laura Jones
        
    - Current system limitation: referral contact field only allows single selection, not multiselect
        
    - Three Laura Jones entries found in system, unclear which is correct Mother’s Care contact
        
    - Two Nicole Young entries identified, only one shows Mother’s Care insurance affiliation
        
- **Immediate Solution Path**
    
    - Use Diana Journey’s contact as template for proper referral setup structure
        
    - Mark has permissions to update referral contact info on contact records
        
    - Lead-level updates blocked - requires CRM team intervention (James Bowie or Cody Murray)
        
    - Will escalate multiselect functionality issue to CRM review meeting in 20 minutes
        
- **System Access Constraints**
    
    - E123 integration limitations preventing automated lead flow
        
    - RevOps team lacks admin console access for Epic EHR system
        
    - Account merge operations restricted to CRM team only
        

### ServiceNow Ticket Processing Workflow

- **IT Infrastructure Requests**
    
    - Randy Gonzalez Epic access request → Route to Service Desk (general IT, not RevOps scope)
        
    - Sales app installation to work cells → Service Desk handles mobile device management
        
    - Service Desk serves as central IT routing hub for non-CRM requests
        
- **CRM Operations Tickets**
    
    - **Gloria McLean New Intake Setup**
        
        - Enrollment rep: Samantha identified
            
        - Historical outreach specialist: Shalom (inside sales agent) assigned for credit tracking
            
        - Scheduled for 3:10 PM Eastern (12:00 PM Pacific conversion applied)
            
        - Veteran status field completion required before intake scheduling
            
        - Result: Intake #148 created, routed to Samantha’s pipeline
            
    - **Deleted Appointment Recovery**
        
        - User accidentally deleted intake appointment, breaking enrollment association
            
        - CRM team must recreate appointment AND restore enrollment linkage
            
        - Template created for similar “associated intake” requests
            
    - **Contact Type Correction Issues**
        
        - Prospect status prevents funnel review visibility
            
        - Should be “potential participant” for active pipeline tracking
            
        - Outreach specialists scheduling incorrectly causing downstream problems
            
- **Access Management & Templates**
    
    - Nicole pilot program access setup in progress
        
    - Document punch list template available for CRM team routing
        
    - Susan handling multiple handoffs, reducing RevOps workload
        
    - Template system reducing repetitive ticket responses
        

### Issues Log & Blockers

    - Ongoing broker system issues with no recent updates

- **Duplicate Records Management**

    - Account merge requests accumulating, need CRM team batch processing

    - Lead-level modifications restricted to CRM team
        
    - Appointment association requires elevated privileges

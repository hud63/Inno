### Lead Duplicate Management Problem

- System now capturing leads from multiple sources (Innovage, E123, other brokers)
    
- Current process closes out duplicate leads, losing tracking capability
    
- Problem: Can’t accurately track lead-to-enrollment conversions when duplicates are closed
    
- Taxonomy data becomes incomplete due to lost associations
    

### Proposed Technical Solutions

- Solution 1: Multi-lead tracking system
    
    - Allow multiple leads per contact (treating leads as actions, not people)
        
    - When lead qualifies/proceeds, check for existing matches
        
    - Update status of matched leads and associate all to same contact/enrollment
        
    - Maintains complete taxonomy structure throughout process
        
    - Preserves E123 ID passing and enrollment associations
        
- Solution 2: Duplicate prevention at intake
    
    - Add logic to broker submission flow (CloudFlow)
        
    - Check for existing leads before creation
        
    - Send notification email if duplicate found
        
    - Prevent duplicate creation entirely
        
- Both solutions can be implemented simultaneously
    
    - Solution 1 ensures complete taxonomy accuracy
        
    - Solution 2 keeps payment structure cleaner
        

### Payment Policy Decision Needed

- Current approach: Pay all brokers even for duplicates (per Tony’s “goodwill” policy)
    
- Risk: System can be gamed by coordinating brokers
    
    - Multiple brokers could submit same lead intentionally
        
    - Split payments between themselves
        
- Recommended approach: First-to-submit gets paid
    
    - Timestamp tracking determines priority
        
    - Similar to recruiter industry standard (20% first-year salary)
        
- Requires Tony/sales team decision on payment policy
    
- Need guidelines for edge cases (e.g., multiple submissions within 24 hours)
    

### Next Steps

- Mark will schedule follow-up meeting with Tony (Thursday or Friday)
    
- Review proposed solutions with sales leadership
    
- Establish clear payment policy guidelines
    
- Technical implementation pending sales decision

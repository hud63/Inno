| Prospective Participant Meeting Script |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Through the analyzation of available data, we have identified the top four reasons for Prospective Prospects to have their records closed before becoming an active Participant, and/or for rapidly disenrolling from the program. In rank of order from one to four, those reasons, and likely root causes are: |  |
|  | 1\. Does not want to change primary care physician/doctor. \- Either we did not dive deep enough into their need to show the true value of the PACE/LIFE benefit, or we did not demonstrate the inadequacy of their current situation enough. |
|  | 2\. Does not want to change HMO/MA. \- Our current line of questioning did not take them from "comfortable" to a place of realizing significant "pain or gain." |
|  | 3\. Does not want to change HCBS/IHSS/Home Care. \- Our current line of questioning did not take them from "comfortable" to a place of realizing significant "pain or gain." |
|  | 4\. Medicaid issues. \- We did not do an adequate job of explaining the process that was sufficient to support the job of the Enroller. |
| The following script of first, second, and third level questions and "words that work" have been created with your input, and has been organized to flow in a manner following the four closure reasons listed above, and to greatly reduce, if not eliminate, those reasons and causes when used properly. |  |
| First level questions are designed to get the Prospective Participant and/or their Caregiver to talk openly about their current situation or needs, and also to identify problems, difficulties and dissatisfactions in areas where PACE/LIFE can help. They begin to take the PP and their CG on the journey to PACE/LIFE. |  |
| Second level questions are typically more complex and sophisticated, and take the PP's and/or CG's needs or situation and get them to explore their effects, helping them understand the seriousness of the need or situation. They open the PP and their CG to the benefits of PACE/LIFE when presented. |  |
| Third level questions are called "Need-payoff Questions." They get the PP and/or their CG to tell you the benefits PACE/LIFE can offer, or the pain it will remove. These questions are directly tied to successfully completing the main goal of your meeting \- Getting a 100% vetted PP to an intake meeting with our Enrollment Team. |  |
| Many of the responses you receive from the Potential Participants and/or their Caregivers in the initial section of this script are very likely to provide you additional, and very valuable, 3rd Level questions for the Self-Pay section of the script. Why are they very valuable? Because you will be using the Potential Participant's and Caregiver's own words to make them not only more emotionally attached to our program, but also more rationally attached. When making a decision to spend your own money, ration very often plays a role on par with emotion. This is where the "Situational Awareness" and "Poise" bullet point from the training comes into play. It is also why it is important to use this script, in its entirety, in every meeting where you are attempting to convert a Lead into a Potential Participant. The script is designed to not only flow through the reasons Potential Participants do not enter our program and overcome those objections before they are raised, it is designed to work in tandem with the Financial Discovery section of the Discovery Form, especially when the Path the Potential Participant will take to enter PACE/LIFE is Self-Pay. |  |

| Need/Situation identifying question(s) | Prospective Participant Response | Rank | PACE/LIFE Benefit "Words That Work" |
| Level 1 Fact Finding Questions: \- How many hours of home care do you currently receive per month? \- Is there a financial component involved? (If a family member providing the care, then they likely rely on that as all or part of their income.) \- Does your home care provide task based or hours based assistance? |  |  |  |
| 1st Level: Tell me about your bathing. Are you taking a sponge bath or partial bath, or are you able to take a full bath or shower? Does someone help you with your bathing? |  |  | Calculate "Center Days" 40 or less \= 2 Center days per week (5 hrs each) 41-80 \= 2 Center days/week, wake up 5 days/week while family works (5 hours), light housekeeping (1 hour), 1 load of laundry (1 hour), meal prep for five days (5 hours), add up to 22 hours/week or roughly 80/month. We can help families get in touch with our homecare agencies. While they will not be assigned to the patient, they may be able to pick up regular caseloads if they qualify. This would allow the family member to receive the benefits of enhanced care coordination and retain the income through a homecare company. \- A Task based program assesses the needs of the participant. \- Caregivers are required to perform the tasks assigned and will not use hours toward other tasks that are not needs. \- By recognizing needs, the participant is able to receive assistance and not develop a crutch simultaneously. The goal is to keep the participant independent as long as possible, for their benefit. Assigning hours that would go toward needs AND unassigned tasks would jeopardize the participant's ability maintain long-term independence. |
| 2nd Level: Do you feel at all unsteady when you enter or exit the bathtub or shower, or while standing when showering? |  |  |  |

| 3rd Level: How would it feel if bathing or showering became easier, safer and more regular? |  |  |  |
| 1st Level: Do you currently utilize a paid caregiver of any type? (Do we need to explain what OUR definition of a paid caregiver is by giving examples like we did for "things" above?) |  |  | Calculate "Center Days" 40 or less \= 2 Center days per week (5 hrs each) 41-80 \= 2 Center days/week, wake up 5 days/week while family works (5 hours), light housekeeping (1 hour), 1 load of laundry (1 hour), meal prep for five days (5 hours), add up to 22 hours/week or roughly 80/month.

| 3rd Level: What would the benefit be to you if the services provided by your paid caregiver were included at no extra charge? (OR: What is the impact to your monthly budget to have to pay for the services provided by your caregiver every month?) |  |  |  |
| 1st Level: Tell me about how your laundry gets done. Do you do your laundry on your own, or does someone assist you with it? |  |  | Calculate "Center Days" 40 or less \= 2 Center days per week (5 hrs each) 41-80 \= 2 Center days/week, wake up 5 days/week while family works (5 hours), light housekeeping (1 hour), 1 load of laundry (1 hour), meal prep for five days (5 hours), add up to 22 hours/week or roughly 80/month. We can help families get in touch with our homecare agencies. While they will not be assigned to the patient, they may be able to pick up regular caseloads if they qualify. This would allow the family member to receive the benefits of enhanced care coordination and retain the income through a homecare company. \- A Task based program assesses the needs of the participant. \- Caregivers are required to perform the tasks assigned and will not use hours toward other tasks that are not needs. \- By recognizing needs, the participant is able to receive assistance and not develop a crutch simultaneously. The goal is to keep the participant independent as long as possible, for their benefit. Assigning hours that would go toward needs AND unassigned tasks would jeopardize the participant's ability maintain long-term independence. |
| 2nd Level: Does this have any impact on how often your laundry gets done, or how well? |  |  |  |

| 1st Level: I appreciate and empathize with your position. However, it is important that you understand the full implications of not having a complete understanding of the state's regulations and certification process, as it could cause you (or loved one) to be disenrolled from the program at a time when you (they) need it even more. You wouldn't want to that happen to you (your loved one), right? |  |  |  |
| 2nd Level: If you decide not to discuss it now, here is what could happen (revisit the costs of future care and the pain points of current care that would return if they are disenrolled.) We want to make sure that doesn't happen to you (loved one). Shall we outline the process now? |  |  |  |
| 3rd Level: There are state regulations and requirements to their program which are very advantageous to complete now. Doing so may prevent you (loved one) not certifying , avoiding a penalty period that would interrupt your (loved one's) care, and could put you (loved one) in "a situation." |  |  |  |

| Discussion of funds and handling Medicaid discussions |  |  |  |
| Need/Situation identifying question(s) | Prospective Participant Response | Rank | PACE/LIFE Benefit "Words That Work" |
| Rushing too quickly to discussing Medicaid coverage can be off-putting and derail your entire meeting. Having situation awareness and poise can help set the right and professional tone for this discussion. Utilizing the Mirroring and Reflective Listening techniques taught in the training is critical to the success of this discussion. |  |  |  |
| Determining the PP has resources they could use to fund their care and remain independent, but that those resources may only cover a short or intermediate period of time, the discussion need to reflect and mirror the PP and their family's disposition. |  |  |  |
| 1st Level: What I heard you say previously (use their words to show you heard and understood their financial situation regarding them having finite means), is that correct? There are options to continue your care beyond the time your means expire, and at that point, the state may fund your continuing care. How much do you understand about those options, and how you would convert to that type of care? |  |  |  |
| 2nd Level: Begin by explaining the state's criteria for them paying for the PP's care, being sure to clearly state "the state's criteria" and not "our criteria." Do these things make sense to you? Continue to clarify as needed. |  |  |  |
| 3rd Level: At this point in the discussion, many Potential Participants of our program wonder whey they would have to consider these criteria now, when they won't need the state's assistance for a while. Do you share in that wondering? Explain the state (again, not us), in order to pay for care, has set up specific guidelines they must follow, and if not done correctly, could result in the state not paying for care and you or your loved one would have to disentoll from our program and there would be a disruption in the care needed to keep you independent and living on your terms. With proper planning, this interruption can be avoided. |  |  |  |

| Need/Situation identifying question(s) | Prospective Participant Response | Rank | PACE/LIFE Benefit "Words That Work" |
| 1st Level, you will need to refer to section one of the script for this: Earlier in our discussion, you said, "(reflect back the benefit they need or the pain they need removed) is causing you to have valid concerns or challenges regarding remaining independent. By delaying your entry into the program, you (loved one) would end up with a (situation resulting from their earlier words, fall, etc.) that could send you (loved one) to the hospital, then to a nursing facility by delaying, you wouldn't want that, right? |  |  |  |
| 2nd Level: There are two costs to consider here, one is the tangible funds that you (loved one) have, the other is the cost to you if you (loved one) have a major issue that could have been avoided by getting into the right care now. How important is it to you to avoid these costs? |  |  |  |
| 3rd Level: You've heard the cliché "Penny wise and pound foolish," right? That means saving a little now, can come at a large expense later. In this case, that is in terms of care, safety, honoring commitments to help them stay independent, etc. I know you want to honor those commitments to help yourself (loved one) stay independent. Acting now can give you a better situation both now and in the future. How would securing those items now make you feel? |  |  |  |

| Self-Pay and Assisted Living Facilities (ALF's) |
| :---- |
| An introduction (Read before moving forward), and four situations to consider |
| Assisted Living Facilities, or ALF's, are part of the senior care solutions that can work with PACE. The ALF is for more complex health/social situations that may be needed, but to be clear, placement in an ALF is not the preferred solution, as PACE services work to delay or eliminate the need for an ALF. They do not provide the independence of, nor honor the wishes of the, individual to be independent. In addition, ALF placement adds significant expense to the payer (self or Medicaid). |
| Placement in an ALF from the PACE program is determined by the IDT and not by the PPT or the family. Prior to being in a PACE program, the PPT and family determine placement and pay for the ALF. |
| Four situations to consider: |
| 1\. Coming to PACE thinking they need to go into an ALF. |
| 2\. Coming to PACE an ALF may be needed during Self-Pay time. |
| 3\. Coming to PACE and an ALF may be needed after conversion to Medicaid. |
| 4\. Coming to PACE via Self-Pay and currently residing in an ALF. |

| 1st Level, This question seeks to understand their logic that may have been developed prior to understanding what PACE can do so they may need their logic reconsidered to avoid moving forward with an ALF: What are your thoughts on why you think an ALF is an immediate solution for you? |  |  |  |
| 2nd Level: You may be able to have an honest discussion with them about having them be able to stay in their current housing and to help them with their desire to stay out of a facility and remain with family, friends and (church, stores, neighbors), and away from an institution/ALF that could be more dangerous with COVID: Let's discuss the pro's and con's of moving into an ALF. (Be prepared to create a "Plus Delta" chart for this.) |  |  |  |
| 3rd Level: You can enroll in PACE and, if in the future, our IDT determines the higher level of support of an ALF is needed, we will outline the implications of entering the ALF while you are self-funding your PACE care, or after the conversion to the state's needs based program has begun or was completed. |  |  |  |

| Situation 2: Coming to PACE/LIFE and ALF may be needed during Self-Pay time |  |  |  |
| Need/Situation identifying question(s) | Prospective Participant Response | Rank | PACE/LIFE Benefit "Words That Work" |
| If the Potential Participant thinks they need or will need placement in an ALF, they must know these three things. |  |  |  |
| 1: The determination for ALF placement while in the PACE program is made by IDT, not the participant. The IDT must make that determination through PACE services in order for our PACE program to place and coordinate payment. (they do not have the option o paying for the ALF separately and can choose any one they want within our catchment. Generally, that will not be an option due to total costs of both programs) |  |  |  |
| 2: The ALF InnovAge contracted rate, which may vary by facility (verify the specific rate with your Center Director), will be used to determine the supportive housing calculation of their Self-Pay requirement or the ALF portion. If an ALF is not specified, an average can be used in the SHF to develop a potential cost if that were needed by the Participant. This calculation can be to help them understand the costs they may incur and/or help them make decisions. The share of costs from the SHF generally is all of their income, minus a personal needs allowance, up to a cap of the maximum, cost of the InnovAge negotiated rate for the ALF. |  |  |  |
| 3: The Participant will pay for the following as a PACE Participant: \- PACE Rate \+ Part D, and… \- The ALF portion derived from the SHF Having to pay both of these costs may impact their decision to enter an ALF sooner or later, or whether they want to continue with PACE, but better to know earlier so they are not surprised (remember, surprises kill sales). This increase in the funding of their care will accelerate their medically necessary expenditures and shorten the time period to conversion to Medicaid. |  |  |  |

| Situation 4: Coming to PACE/LIFE and currently residing in an ALF |
| If they are currently in an ALF, the first thing to understand is it an InnovAge contracted facility or not? |
| If they are in a non-contracted facility, they would be responsible for the ongoing costs for the ALF, unless they transition to one of our contracted ALF's. If they want to transition into an InnovAge ALF, then the IDT would need to make that determination/authorization and then a transition would need to be completed. |
| If they are currently in an InnovAge contracted ALF, then InnovAge IDT will need to make the determination that they should continue to be in the ALF. Since they will be in PACE, they will need to follow the CMS regulations that we utilize and in situation 2\. |
| The Participant will pay for the following as a PACE Participant: \- PACE rate \+ Part D, and… \- The ALF portion derived from the SHF. The share of costs from the SHF generally is all of their income, minus a personal needs allowance, up to the cap of the maximum cost of the InnovAge negotiated rate for the ALF. |
| Having to pay both of these costs may impact their decision to enter PACE, but better to know earlier so they are not surprised (remember, surprises kill sales). |

| Recovery for current Dual Pay Participant whose asset/income level jeopardizes their status |
| Situation: Current participant has either saved up funds or otherwise had assets come to them and that puts them over the Medicaid resource limit. They do not want to use these new assets to fund their own care and are willing to disenroll from PACE rather than fund their PACE portion. They may be focused on having these new funds or a family member may be pushing them to disenroll so they can gain benefit from the new resources. |
| They are focused on the funds and not on the disruption to their continuity of care and potential impact to their health. This is more of discussion of the future, don’t over focus on today. Use today’s pain points plus the future potential hazards to discuss their situation and what they want for the future. |
| Other determinants to understand in preparation: |
| · Length of time in PACE. |
| · Overall satisfaction with program, care, activities, staff and other participants. |
| · Benefits from relationships and activities or other health delivery items (without copays). |
| There are four areas of discussion that can help: |
| 1\. What are you planning to do with the new money? Since they have been in the program for a duration there is ability to gain an understanding of the funds, how they received and what they are thinking of doing with them. Provides insights on their motivations. |
| 2\. Where they a considering going to? Determination of the care they wish to transition to and the implications/differences as well as short comings and potential downsides from changing. |
| 3\. Review their PACE experience. Reinforcement of the value of PACE for them and impact on their care, continuity and coordination and wishes for independence. |
| 4\. They are better off staying with PACE. Determine the value of the new resources and how that it will be more beneficial to stay in PACE. |
| New Money ? |
| 1st Level: How did you come into this new money? Probe, if it is saving their Social Security and then they are over resourced, they may be able to have a process to not have it in their account but still have it benefit. |
| 2nd Level: What are your plans for it? Provides their thoughts on what then will do for themselves or others, might also figure out how much and how fast. |
| 3rd Level: Have you considered ways to stay in the program and how to use the funds to pay for your care so it is not interrupted? |
| Determination of the care they wish to transition to and the implications/differences as well as short comings and potential downsides from changing |
| 1st Level: What care and provider are you planning? Probe for MA or Traditional Medicare plan and any Supplemental (Gap insurance) and discuss the challenges of finding the right provider and having to self-navigate their care and short term benefits (from Part 2 of the Self-Pay presentations). |
| 2nd Level: (Understanding their health and social situation). What happens if you have a major challenge with (Insert situation(s) and you have to get care longer term. |
| 3rd Level: How will you pay for those and if that situation progresses? Probe to outline that family may have to pay out of their pockets, they may not qualify quickly for Medicaid, etc. |
| Reinforcement of the value of PACE for them and impact on their care, coordination and wishes for independence |
| 1st Level: Tell me about your experience with PACE? Probe for relationships with staff, caring from SW, other, Drivers, etc. as well as any major events that have benefited the PPT to remind them of the value of PACE. |
| 2nd Level: changing to a new plan and provider don’t have the same high touch care that you are used to and what will happen when you have an urgent issue? (compare to PACE) |
| Determine the value of the new resources and how that it will be more beneficial to stay in PACE |
| 1st Level: How does your new plan coordinate your care, do they have an IDT? |
| 2nd Level: Continuity of care is critical and this is a big transition, what happens if they don’t care for you like PACE? |
| 3rd Level: Does the risk of care lapse and if you have to go into a SNF make it worth having some money now that could leave you out of options if an event arises? |
| With all that, doesn’t it make sense to stay in PACE, fund your own care and stay in PACE so you can remain independent and know your care is in the right hands? |

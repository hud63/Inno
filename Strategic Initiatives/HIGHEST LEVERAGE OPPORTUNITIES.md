**TAKE INVOCA/INSIDE SALES BEST PRACTICES AND USE FOR FIELD REPS**
### The Core Pattern (Use This as Your North Star)

**Everything bottlenecks at qualification accuracy.**

- Bad qualification → wasted intake visits → Financial rejection (34%)
- Bad qualification → wasted nurse LOC visits → HSD rejection
- Bad qualification → 61-day cycle with senior who ghosts at the end
- Bad qualification → stale leads sitting in pipeline for 415 days

**The highest-leverage thing you can do:** Perfect the qualification questions (discovery + intake scripts) so that by the time an Enrollment Rep schedules an intake, there’s 80%+ confidence the senior will enroll.

Every hour spent improving qualification saves 10 hours downstream.

### Additional Force-Multiplier Opportunities

**1. Financial Probing Questions at First Contact**

- Financial eligibility is the #1 bottleneck (34% approval rate)
- EFD spends weeks chasing 2-5 year bank statements from seniors with closed accounts, no online banking
- **Leverage play:** Add 3-5 upfront financial qualifier questions to Contact Center and OS scripts that weed out ineligible prospects BEFORE scheduling intake
- Impact: Eliminates 30-40% of wasted intake appointments and saves 61-day cycle waste
- ROI: Every senior you disqualify in a 20-minute call saves 2+ hours of Enrollment Rep time + nurse visit + EFD team hours

**2. Caregiver Involvement Protocol (3x Conversion Multiplier)**

- Caregiver-initiated leads convert at 3x the rate of senior self-initiated
- Current approach doesn’t systematically involve caregivers early
- **Leverage play:** Train Contact Center and OS to ASK: “Is there a family member or caregiver we should include in this conversation?” Make it standard in the script.
- Impact: If you shift even 20% of senior-only leads to caregiver-involved leads, you could see 40-60% boost in qualified-to-enrolled conversion
- Why it works: Caregivers are honest about ADLs, financial situation, and urgency; seniors are prideful and hide struggles

**3. Train-the-Trainer System for RSDs and Enrollment Managers**

- You have ~100 reps but only ~10-15 sales leaders (RSDs, Enrollment Managers)
- Currently you’re expected to train all 100 directly (impossible with 0.5 FTE on this)
- **Leverage play:** Build facilitator guides, slide decks, role-play scripts for sales leaders. Train THEM to deliver your playbook to their teams.
- Impact: 10x force multiplication. One hour with an RSD = that RSD training 8 OSes = 80 hours of rep training
- Creates sustainability: When new reps join or playbook updates, leaders own rollout

**4. Broker Channel Assumptive-Close Script (Unlock Scaling)**

- Broker leads are higher quality (existing relationship, book of business) but currently treated same as cold digital leads
- Sherry identified this gap; Contact Center needs different approach
- **Leverage play:** Create separate “broker lead track” script for Contact Center with assumptive language: “Your broker shared your info. Let me confirm what they told me and get you scheduled.”
- Impact: If broker conversion rate jumps from 15-20% to 30-40%, and FMO channel explodes as expected, this becomes your #1 enrollment source within 6 months
- Timing: Do this NOW before broker volume scales, or you’ll be firefighting with angry FMOs

**5. Top 10 Pipeline Offenders Cleanup Sprint (Credibility Builder)**

- Linda (379 leads), Josh, Alex, Alejandro have years-old stale leads
- New Power BI dashboard solves the problem, but adoption is lagging
- **Leverage play:** Host 2-3 focused “pipeline blitz” sessions with worst offenders. Live coaching, screen-share, close out 200+ stale leads in one week.
- Impact: Immediate visible results; reps see their dashboard go from “overwhelming red” to “manageable green”
- Builds your credibility fast: “Mark helped me clean 300 leads in 2 hours. Now I know what to do.”
- Creates champions who evangelize the new workflow to peers

**6. Channel-Specific Playbook Modules (14 Referral Sources)**

- OSes prospect via 14+ channels (hospitals, senior centers, community orgs, APS, food banks, SNFs, ALFs, etc.)
- Each requires totally different approach (event-based vs. gatekeeper-based vs. clinical liaison)
- Currently inconsistent; reps “figure it out” themselves
- **Leverage play:** Build one channel playbook per month. Start with highest-volume channels (hospitals, senior centers). Include: gatekeeper scripts, objection handling, relationship-building cadence, success stories.
- Impact: Transforms “I don’t know how to approach this account” into “I have a step-by-step process”
- Why high-leverage: OSes generate their own leads. Better prospecting = more qualified leads = higher team enrollment numbers without spending more on digital

**7. LOC Pre-Qualification Checklist (Reduce Nurse Visit Waste)**

- Nurses perform LOC assessments, but reps don’t know exact criteria
- Some seniors fail LOC because reps scheduled intake without understanding ADL threshold
- **Leverage play:** Partner with nursing leadership to extract the “must-have ADLs” for LOC approval. Build a 5-question checklist for reps: “Do you need help with bathing? Dressing? Toileting? Transferring? Eating?”
- Impact: Reduces nurse visit waste; nurses only go to seniors who will pass
- Bonus: Helps HSD too—if senior is struggling with 4+ ADLs, might be “too sick” red flag

## Prioritization Logic

**Do first (next 30 days):**

1. Top 10 Pipeline Cleanup Sprint — fast win, builds credibility
2. Financial Probing Questions — stops the 34% bottleneck bleed
3. Broker Assumptive-Close Script — channel is about to scale, must be ready

**Do second (30-60 days):** 4. Caregiver Involvement Protocol — 3x multiplier, needs script + training rollout 5. Channel-Specific Playbook (start with top 2 channels)

**Do third (60-90 days):** 6. Train-the-Trainer System — creates sustainability for everything above 7. LOC Pre-Qualification Checklist — requires cross-functional partnership with nursing

**Why this order:**

- Quick wins build credibility and buy you time
- Financial/Broker are immediate business needs (bottleneck + scaling channel)
- Caregiver and Channel work are higher complexity but massive ROI
- Train-the-trainer creates the infrastructure so everything else scales without you being the bottleneck

 1. Documentation "Optimization" (Easiest Win)

  - Reorganize existing files into different folders
  - Create "improved versions" of current documents by slightly rewording
  - Add tables of contents to existing markdown files
  - Create summary documents that copy/paste from existing files

  Specific Documents to Use:
  - Use üèóÔ∏è InnovAge Workflows (Full Markdown Conversion).md to create separate focused documents like "Broker Channel Quick Start Guide" and "Campaign
  Management Summary"
  - Leverage WHO makes WHAT types of decisions.md to create "Leadership Decision Matrix" and "Contact Reference Guide"
  - Transform üß© InnovAge Tech Stack.md into "System Integration Overview" and "Vendor Contact List"
  - Use enrollment QA documents to create "Quality Assurance Checklist" compilation

  Effort: 15-30 minutes per "deliverable"
  Visibility: Looks like thorough documentation work

  2. Meeting Follow-ups & Action Items

  - Send detailed emails after meetings recapping what was discussed
  - Create "action item tracking" documents from existing process flows
  - Generate "status updates" by repackaging existing workflow documentation

  Specific Data to Use:
  - Extract pipeline stages from the workflows document to create "Weekly Pipeline Status Updates"
  - Use the decision-making matrix to send "Stakeholder Alignment Summaries" after meetings
  - Pull from enrollment process documentation to create "Process Improvement Tracking" updates
  - Leverage tech stack information for "System Integration Status" reports

  Effort: 10-20 minutes per update
  Visibility: Regular communication appears proactive

  3. Template Creation

  - Turn existing workflows into "standardized templates"
  - Create checklists from the enrollment processes you've documented
  - Design "quick reference guides" from detailed process documentation

  Specific Documents to Use:
  - Convert the "Intake Readiness Checklist" section into standalone templates
  - Use "Participant Pipeline" stages to create "Lead Status Tracking Template"
  - Transform "Functional Assessment Workflow" into "Nurse Scheduling Template"
  - Create "Campaign Taxonomy Template" from the campaigns system design
  - Build "Account Health Monitoring Template" from outreach pipeline categories

  Effort: 20-40 minutes per template
  Visibility: Creates reusable assets for the team

  4. Dashboard & Reporting Mockups

  - Create PowerPoint presentations with charts from existing pipeline data
  - Design dashboard mockups based on the funnel stages documented
  - Build "executive summary" formats for existing reports

  Specific Data to Use:
  - Use the 9-stage Participant Pipeline to create funnel conversion charts
  - Build "Broker Channel Performance" dashboard from FMO workflow data
  - Create "Cycle Time Analysis" visuals from the documented stage durations
  - Design "Campaign Effectiveness" dashboard from taxonomy examples
  - Build "Account Health Distribution" charts from outreach categories

  Effort: 30-60 minutes per visual deliverable
  Visibility: High - leadership loves visual reports

  5. Process Improvement "Documentation"

  - Document "current state" vs "future state" workflows (using existing content)
  - Create "requirements documents" for improvements mentioned in meetings
  - Write "technical specifications" for the integrations already described

  Specific Documents to Use:
  - Use "Parking Lot (Future Enhancements)" section to create "Enhancement Requirements Documents"
  - Transform broker channel workflow into "Process Optimization Proposal"
  - Create "API Integration Specifications" from the tech stack integrations described
  - Build "Role-Based Dashboard Requirements" from mentioned future enhancements
  - Document "SLA Standardization" using the various approval workflows

  Effort: 45-90 minutes per document
  Visibility: Appears strategic and thorough

  Optimal Approach

  Best ROI: Focus on #1 and #2 - documentation tweaks and meeting follow-ups using the existing workflow and decision documentation.

  Leadership Visibility: Emphasize #4 - create dashboards from the pipeline stages and campaign data already documented.

  Team Value: Prioritize #3 - build templates from the intake readiness checklists and assessment workflows.

  Implementation Schedule

  Daily: Send status updates using pipeline stage data (10 minutes)
  Weekly: Create one enhanced document or template from existing workflows (30 minutes)
  Monthly: Produce a dashboard or executive summary using documented metrics (60 minutes)

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**: Okay not a problem, you know how alot of attorneys are wearing all the hats while running the business and it causes them to have to work in the business instead of on it? Well we help attorneys like that by looking at hidden gaps in their marketing strategy so they can bring in more leads and stand out in their market.

hey what we’re doing is actually a free 14 day challenge to help you get from where you are now so would you be open for us just to be giving you a free bit of help just a pure sort of value add.  So we can help you kind of achieve your goals over the next 14 days.  What’s a goal you would love to achieve over next 14 days?  What do you need in order to ensure that you can do that?  (email text checks day 5/10/13 call2 day 14)

I do apologize if I interrupted something there in that regard just to see if the conversation would be worth continuing for you. Like,

have you found what you’re looking for in terms of growing the firm, or are you still looking?

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Hi, NAME, this is just Mark with Bill Hauser’s team, I'm not sure if you remember us...

I think you had recently registered for one of our trainings about possibly getting some outside help with marketing to grow the firm. And I just had a moment to get back to you.  Were you able to attend that and go through that or where are you in that regards?

Bill always wants us to reach out and essentially see if you have  // you were able to attend that and hear some of the takeaways to see if there is anything we do that could help.    //    have you found what you’re looking for in terms of like growing the firm, or are you still possibly..looking for options?

**[[[**Oh you did and this might sound a little..cheesy but on a scale of 1-10, 1 being a definitely isn’t for you and 10 being that it could be,   i guess where, where do you think that fits with potentially applying some of those principles to your practice?

(what do i get?) Yeah we can definitely go through some details if you like, to be candid I’m not 100% sure really anything we do could help you in the first place..it might be a bit more appropriate if i understood a bit more about what your doing..now marketing wise and what you might be looking for just to see if we could help**]]]**

Ok fair enough and what are you currently doing to __ & __ (possibly get more leads or _)?

And how long have you been doing it that way?

So this sort of process that you’ve had in place (context here), do you..um do you (tilt head)...do you like the process you have?

-       Ok well you’ve been doing it X time, so you must like it some way, _and i definitely don’t want to give us a job we don’t need to give_, let’s talk about the positive, what do you like about it?

-       Tell me, what caused you to do it that way?

(Well, apart from __) So to me it sounds like things are going (fairly well^/ok/not too bad) for you, is there is there anything you would change about (potentially the way your going about it or the outcomes your getting / what you're doing)..if you could?

_(if change nothing)_   Are you fulfilling your dreams or would you like to be doing something else / could be doing better?

-       What do you mean __?

-       And i guess is that having an impact on, on your ability to, you know, maybe grow?

-       In what way(s)?

-       What is doing everything within the business preventing you from actually doing though?

All right. Well, is it right if I just ask you some specific questions about the practice NAME, the reason I want to do that, I just want to see if there's a possibility of us maybe being how to help you further, you know, (leads/marketing) and, you know, maybe get control over your team, which is clearly the thing holding your, your at bay.

So, um, how many, how many cases do you actually have?

Okay. And, um, I'll put my accounting hat on for a minute. What, what are you doing in let's say annual revenue wise or monthly revenue?

Okay. And let's say 12 months from now, like, let's say you had some better (leads/marketing) that was more streamlined. (You didn't have to put in 60 hours a week). How many, how much do you want to be kind of turning over, what do you want to see that grow to?

**[[[**because I get it from your current perspective. Your current perspective is, Hey, I'm ... Right. So I get it from that perspective, but let's, let's kind of remove that barrier. It doesn't have to be that way. Let's say you could grow it. You're currently doing X million. What do you want to grow at two? If you could, don't worry about the, how you leave that to me. **]]]**

 Okay. What difference would that make, like what would that open up for you?

Yeah. Okay. All right. That makes sense. And are you the sole owner or like do you have partners?

-       All right. So it's probably something he/they want as well, like in terms of…

 Let me recap. I appreciate you sharing all of that NAME, but it sounds to me like you're at the point now…

And because of that, yeah. I can see how that's potentially frustrating you a little bit at the moment. Is that right?

Okay. Well I think what we're doing might work for you so that the next step from here it's appropriate. We can organize a longer conversation. We can do that over zoom, **[[**probably get your partner(s)on that. He's probably going to see things from a different perspective than you.**]]** Um, and then from there I can actually walk you through like what we do and how we might be able to help you streamline some of the __ aspects and, you know, get you growing the business and just getting you __ so you can, you know, be more fulfilled rather than __  guess. But would that be appropriate? Would you be, would you be open to that?

So NAME, from what I hear at the moment, you kind of just rely on (referrals) and you're not able to (triple your business) so that you can step out and maybe do the more important things that you would maybe be doing as an attorney. Can I make a suggestion? Well, I'm not really sure yet, but what we do in terms of lead gen could actually work for you and if you'd be open to it. Would you may be open to having a conversation with one of our heads of strategy just to see if we could possibly help you generate those extra leads? Would that help you out?

All right, we'll do that over zoom. I'm going to pull up my calendar right now. Let's see if we can block out 60 minutes together. Um, are you both available on DAY at TIME your time by any chance?

between now and the next call. Do you think it will be helpful? Cause every quarter I get my clients to complete a hundred point strategy audit assessment and it just helps them figure out what's missing in the business. If it takes about maybe five, six minutes, Scotty, can you sit down with Sasha and actually complete that for me? Oh sure. Yep. I think that would be helpful or send it to your email. You also want me to send you some case studies of some of our clients that you remind me of just so you can see the results they got when they applied to the visit and yeah.

Yup. Yeah. You noticed you're not alone, man. Just, just get a feel for the type of people we work with. Um, you'll notice that. Yeah, this is pretty common. Most people end up with a job when I want a business, but they're able to turn that around within six to 12 months with the right strategy. So just get a feel and then ask yourself the question. Am I like these people in terms of their willingness to turn it around, which is what it comes down to. Let me just make sure I've got your correct email

All right. Perfect. So let me just recap. I've scheduled you both in, and we're chatting 6:00 PM on Friday the eighth with Sasha. Can you block that out of your calendar as well? Scotty, Don. Yeah. Don block it out. I'm going to send you that assessment just to make sure that's completed before we speak. And if you've got any questions from now to Friday, I'll send you a text off to this. You have my personal number. Just, just reach out to me and then I can help you out. All right. Okay. Appreciate it. All right. My pleasure. Looking forward to speaking to you both on Friday. Hello. Thank you. My pleasure. Bye bye.

(Must be in car) Listen, there's a certain information that I have to show you, and  I'm not allowed to have that conversation with you in the car. Like, it's a company policy. 

I'll work around you if you need to do an 8PM, I'll do an 8PM that’s fine.  But when can I actually have your undivided attention.  Because one thing that happens, like when you're driving everybody's at, like, nine out of ten anxiety levels, even though you don't feel it. That's why road rage is a thing.

Can you give me run down of, I guess. Like what your standard day looks like?  What does that mean, Like, you start at five, finish at like, nine?

 hey what we’re doing is actually a free 14 day challenge to help you get from where you are now so would you be open for us just to be giving you a free bit of help just a pure sort of value add.  So we can help you kind of achieve your goals over the next 14 days.  What’s a goal you would love to achieve over next 14 days?  What do you need in order to ensure that you can do that?  (email text checks day 5/10/13 call2 day 14)

_Achieved_ - hey we can probably help you more do you think it would be appropriate to actually have a like a call and take you through how we can potentially help you even further?

_Don’t_ - hey do you feel like more support, if you were able to have this XYZ, do you feel like that would help you some more, so you can actually achieve your goal?  What do you think prevented you from achieving your goals over the last 14 days?

●      Have you found what you were looking for or were you still looking for ways to XYZ?          

●      Okay do you know what you were looking for?  
  

●      So would it be worth having a conversation to see if and how we could possibly help you?  
  

●      Okay well, that's not a problem we can look at rebooking, just before we do that, just so I'm clear, is this still a priority for you?

●      Okay because we did have 45 minutes blocked out and we haven't heard from you so I want to make sure this is a priority, did you ever complete the HOMEWORK? Why not?

●      So we can do that but is this important? (if wishy washy: are you sure? Because you don't have to...)

●      if you're actually serious about insert goals we’re happy to have that conversation but you have to be committed to solving this problem

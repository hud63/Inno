### Immediate/High-Priority

**1. Field Sales Pipeline Cleanup & Dashboard Training**

- Top 10-20 worst performers (Linda: 379 leads, Josh, Alex, etc.) have stale leads from 2022-2024
- Average 415 days for closed leads vs. should be much faster
- New Power BI participant leads pipeline dashboard launched ~1 month ago
- Impact: Train reps to use dashboard, force cleanup in focused sessions
- Quote: “Low hanging fruit. Right? We host one meeting. We get these people… the top 10, and you’ve knocked out a whole chunk of them.”

**2. Intake Script Standardization for Enrollment Reps**

- Current state: Enrollment Reps print their own state-specific forms, write things down, key in later leaving “a ton of blanks”
- Needed: Blow out the discovery script into a full intake script for the 2-hour in-home meeting
- Quote: “I would love for you to actually take that discovery script, blow it out a little bit so that it’s an intake script, then we could train the enrollment reps on what we want them to cover.”
- Connected initiative: Teams recording + AI transcription + Copilot form-fill to reduce manual data entry

**3. Sales Playbook Creation**

- Your primary deliverable; never-ending iteration
- Must cover all 14 referral source channels with specific scripts/approaches for each (community orgs, hospitals, senior centers, APS, food banks, ALFs, short-term SNFs, etc.)
- Glenn will walk you through existing scripting; you need to formalize and train
- Quote: “Your assigned responsibility is a list of one. A sales playbook.”

**4. Broker Channel Script Refinement**

- Broker leads should use “assumptive close” approach vs. starting from square one
- Quote from Sherry: “We should probably retool the script to be a little bit more of an assumptive close. For broker leads where it’s, like, hey. I just wanna validate and verify what you know, Mark, your broker told me.”
- These leads go to Contact Center, but messaging/approach needs differentiation

**5. Marketing Automation (MAP) Requirements Definition**

- MAP is “underutilized” for nurture sequences between qualification → intake → enrollment
- Current state: Welcome message (email/text), intake scheduled confirmation, 24-hour reminder
- Gap: No educational content, objection handling, or case studies in the nurture flow
- You need to work with Gina (marketing) to define: when to send what, rules, content
- Quote: “I need clear requirements from you marketing. When should we send what? What are the rules? What is the content?”

### Medium-Term/Strategic

**6. Channel-Specific Training Development**

- 14 different field prospecting channels each need tailored approaches
- Example differences:
    - Community orgs: Event-based, lunch sponsorships
    - Hospitals: Befriend gatekeeper, schedule ahead, request badge for back-of-house access
    - Short-term SNFs: Focus on rehab patients going home (not permanent placement)
- Weekly training rotation: “This week, we’re gonna talk about how do we sell into a community org.”

**7. Call Recording Analysis & Best Practice Identification**

- Invoka has full call recordings + transcripts for Contact Center
- Signal Discovery pilot coming: AI will identify patterns across successful calls
- You can listen to best performers and extract winning approaches
- Quote: “So to get you up to speed, you can absolutely listen in on those and… hear what the conversation actually looks like.”

**8. HSD Field Requirements Simplification**

- Ongoing “shit storm for two years” around HSD form complexity
- Operators keep asking for more fields; currently 77 fields required
- Quote: “There’s no way we’re gonna fill out 77 fields perfectly every time in a two hour intake meeting… You be in your laptop the whole time. Good luck selling if that was the case.”
- Potential role: Advocate for sales perspective in HSD redesign

**9. FMO/Broker Support Systems**

- E123 portal being built for broker self-service
- Need to ensure tool set is good, analyze performance, train FMOs on what qualifies
- Similar training content as OS, but tailored for external partners with existing senior books of business

## Critical Interconnections & Things You Might Have Missed

### The “Goldilocks Problem” Across the Funnel

**Financial Qualification is the #1 Bottleneck (34% approval)**

- You’re spending $1M/month on digital to generate 3,300 leads/month
- Digital targeting is extremely difficult: must be 55+, correct ZIP, right sickness band, AND poor
- But seniors lie/hide financial info due to pride or lack of awareness
- Then EFD team spends weeks/months chasing 2-5 year bank statement lookbacks
- Closed accounts, no online banking, unstable finances all slow this down

**Impact opportunity you might miss:** The qualification scripts (discovery + intake) need better financial probing questions upfront. If you can help OSes and Contact Center weed out financially ineligible leads BEFORE intake scheduling, you save massive downstream waste.

Quote context: “They don’t have real stable finances. Yeah. I had an account, and I closed it. Well, now I gotta go get a closed account statement.”

### The Pride/Self-Reporting Problem

Seniors underreport ADL struggles → field discovers reality at in-home intake → can lead to:

- Too sick (HSD rejection)
- Not sick enough (LOC rejection)
- Mismatched expectations → ghosting

**Interconnection:** This is why caregiver-initiated leads convert 3x better. The caregiver is desperate and honest; the senior is prideful and evasive.

**Impact opportunity:** Train reps to ASK FOR CAREGIVER INVOLVEMENT early. If OS/Contact Center can get a family member on the phone during qualification, conversion likely spikes.

### The Medicare Advantage Objection is Actually About Loss Aversion

Quote: “I don’t wanna change my PCP. If it’s not number one, it’s, like, number two” objection.

**What you might miss:** This isn’t just about the PCP—it’s loss aversion. Seniors are losing their current insurance, their specialist network, their pharmacy relationships, their routines.

**Impact opportunity:** The playbook needs a robust “here’s what you’re GAINING” positioning framework. The signing ceremony mentions “here’s what you’re giving up, here’s what you’re getting,” but that might be too late. Objection handling should come MUCH earlier—during qualification and nurture.

### The Commission Structure Creates Misaligned Incentives

- OS/Enrollment Reps get paid on monthly enrollments (quota of 7)
- Bonus tiers kick in above 7
- But if they rush low-quality leads through, those leads fail at Financial (34%), HSD, or LOC
- Or worse: enroll and churn quickly, hurting the 13-month residual

**What you might miss:** You need to train not just “how to sell” but “how to qualify OUT bad fits.” The faster they disqualify, the more time they have for good prospects. This is a mindset shift.

**Interconnection:** The 415-day average closed lead age suggests reps are HOPING bad leads will magically convert rather than closing them out. They’re emotionally invested in sunk-cost leads.

### The Tech Stack is Fragmented and Reps Are Drowning

- Field: Power BI dashboard (1 month old), Dynamics CRM, company cell phones (no click-to-call yet), manual pipeline management
- Contact Center: Five9, Invoka, Dynamics, Power BI, ClearView
- No unified “single pane of glass”

**What you might miss:** Reps aren’t resisting training—they’re cognitively overloaded. Linda has 379 open leads because the old way (multiple views, manual closure steps) was too painful. The new dashboard solves this, but adoption is lagging.

**Impact opportunity:** Your training can’t just be “here’s how to use the dashboard.” It needs to be “here’s how this saves you 30 minutes a day and gets you to quota faster.”

### The Broker Channel is About to Explode (and You’re Understaffed)

- Sherry just joined, bringing FMO relationships
- Company already “ahead of Welbe” in broker build/design
- FMOs have massive agent networks; each FMO could send 10x current broker volume
- Broker leads are higher quality (book of business, already rapport with senior)

**What you might miss:** You say half your job is brokers, but this could become 80% of your job in 6 months if the channel takes off. You need SCALABLE enablement (self-service training portal, recorded sessions, FAQ docs) rather than white-glove support for every FMO.

**Interconnection:** If brokers flood the Contact Center with 500 leads/month per FMO and Contact Center isn’t ready with the assumptive-close script, conversion will tank and FMOs will churn.

### The Nursing/LOC Assessment is a Black Box to Sales

- Nurses do the LOC assessment
- Nurses submit to state for approval
- But OSes and Enrollment Reps don’t really understand what nurses are looking for

**What you might miss:** If reps knew the specific LOC criteria, they could pre-qualify better. Example: “Do you need help bathing? Getting dressed? Using the toilet?” These are literal ADL checklist items.

**Impact opportunity:** Partner with nursing leadership to extract the “must-haves” for LOC approval, then train sales on how to probe for those upfront.

### The 61-Day Enrollment Cycle Kills Momentum

From intake → benefits is 61 days on average. Seniors lose interest, circumstances change, they get recruited by competitors.

**What you might miss:** The nurture content (MAP) isn’t just nice-to-have—it’s critical to keeping seniors engaged for 2+ months. But also, anything you can do to SHORTEN this cycle has exponential ROI.

**Impact opportunity:** Analyze the sub-stages (Financial pending, LOC pending, HSD pending) to find where delays cluster. If it’s “waiting for bank statements,” maybe Enrollment Reps need training on how to HELP seniors get online banking set up on the spot.

### You’re Carrying 1.5-2 FTEs of Work (and Alan Knows It)

Quote: “Based on our ratios, we should probably have two sales enablement people. A sales team of a 100… We asked for two FTEs in that business case, and we got a half.”

**What you might miss:** Alan is setting you up to prioritize ruthlessly. He KNOWS you can’t do everything. His repeated “stack up the list of priorities. Which one really is number one?” is coaching you to say NO to requests and focus.

**Impact opportunity:** You need a prioritization framework that’s transparent to leadership. Example: “I’m focused on Field Pipeline Cleanup (affects 40 reps, immediate ROI). Broker enablement is queued next. HSD simplification is backlogged until Q2.”

### The “Teach the Teachers” Leverage Point

- RSDs oversee OSes
- Enrollment Managers oversee Enrollment Reps
- If you train THEM, they train their teams (force multiplication)

**What you might miss:** Your primary customer isn’t the 100 reps—it’s the ~10-15 sales leaders. If they can’t teach the playbook, it doesn’t scale.

**Impact opportunity:** Build “train-the-trainer” sessions for RSDs and Enrollment Managers. Give them facilitator guides, slide decks, role-play scripts. Make them the Heroes.

### The Copilot/Teams Recording Breakthrough is Bigger Than You Think

Alan demoed this ~1 week ago: Teams call → auto-transcription → Copilot form-fill

**What you might miss:** This isn’t just about data entry efficiency. It’s about:

- Enrollment Rep can be PRESENT and build rapport (not head-down typing)
- Compliance/QA can audit every intake for missed steps
- AI can flag “risk signals” (e.g., senior mentioned frequent falls but form says 0 falls)
- You can analyze transcripts to find objection patterns and refine scripts

**Interconnection:** This ties directly to your intake script project. If the script is in Copilot’s “instructions,” it can auto-score whether the rep covered all required topics.

### The “Ghosting” Objection Isn’t Really an Objection

Quote: “Number one is they ghost us. We don’t get a good reason.”

**What you might miss:** Ghosting often means “I’m confused, overwhelmed, or scared to say no.” It’s not apathy—it’s anxiety.

**Impact opportunity:** Train reps on “permission-based closing” techniques. Example: “It’s totally okay if this isn’t the right fit. Can you help me understand what’s making you hesitant?” Give seniors permission to object, and you’ll get real feedback instead of ghosts.

## The Meta-Pattern You Absolutely Can’t Miss

**Everything bottlenecks at qualification accuracy.**

- Bad qualification → wasted intake visits → Financial rejection (34%)
- Bad qualification → wasted nurse LOC visits → HSD rejection
- Bad qualification → 61-day cycle with senior who ghosts at the end
- Bad qualification → stale leads sitting in pipeline for 415 days

**The highest-leverage thing you can do:** Perfect the qualification questions (discovery + intake scripts) so that by the time an Enrollment Rep schedules an intake, there’s 80%+ confidence the senior will enroll.

Every hour spent improving qualification saves 10 hours downstream.

## Final Thought: The Unspoken Urgency

Alan said: “We kill them in terms of field sales. We are at least as good, if not the best, in digital marketing… our biggest competitor, Welbe… cracked the nut here on broker sales, but not here on field sales.”

**Translation:** Innovage has a 6-12 month window to dominate before Welbe catches up on field sales AND before other competitors copy the broker playbook. Your enablement work isn’t just “nice to have”—it’s the moat.

If you can make the Field team execute like the Contact Center (2-day qualification, clean pipelines), and make the Broker channel scale seamlessly, Innovage wins the market.

No pressure. But also: huge opportunity.

# Inside Sales Playbook 2.0

# 1) Open strong, then pivot into Pain → Why Now → Ownership (deeper & earlier)

**Why this matters:**  
Building on our original approach, version 2.0 pushes you to get beyond features and into meaningful conversations more quickly. Start broad, dig to concrete consequences ("so what?"), then press on "why now" and "willingness" to keep paying current costs. While our intro and PACE overview are strong, we've learned we were moving to pre-qual too fast, leaving critical "why now/ownership" value on the table.

### Discovery questions

- "In your own words, what's the biggest challenge you (or your loved one) are facing day-to-day right now?"
    
- "What actually happened the last time this became a problem—can you walk me through yesterday like a story?"
    
- "On a tough day, what gets skipped—meals, meds, hygiene, appointments, getting out of the house?" (Use as a bridge into ADLs later.)
    

### Qualifying questions (data that supports the pain)

- "How many times in the last 30 days did this cause a missed appointment, a fall, or a 911 call?"
    
- "Roughly how many care hours are you covering as a family each week?" (Quantifies caregiver burden—sets up cost of inaction.)
    

### Objection-prevention questions ("so what?" tie-downs)

- "What's the ripple effect when that happens—who else is impacted and how?"
    
- "If nothing changes, what's most likely to happen in the next 90 days?"
    

### Closing questions (ownership/willingness frame—soft trial)

- "How much longer are you willing to keep managing it this way, knowing it's leading to [their words: missed meds/falls/exhaustion]?"
    
- "Are you ready to try a safer path that takes some weight off your shoulders?"
    

### Follow-up questions

- "What changed recently that made you open to help now?" (turning point)
    
- "If we pause here, what usually happens next at home?" (tests urgency and recency)

# 2) Make the ADLs tell a story (tie each ADL to consequences & risk)

**Why this matters:**  
Our ADL grid has always been a strength, but in 2.0 we're adding more depth by converting each ADL to a "tough-day" vignette and quantifying risk (falls, skin breakdown, med errors). This makes state minimums and nursing-home-level-of-care obvious without having to argue the point.

### Discovery questions

- "When bathing on a tough day, what specifically makes it unsafe—balance, steps, reaching your back? Any slips lately?"
    
- "Walk me through getting out of bed to the bathroom at night—what's tricky there?" (Mobility/transfers.)
    
- "What happens with meals when you're tired—opening packages, swallowing, or remembering to eat?"
    

### Qualifying questions

- "How many falls/near-falls in the last 60 days?" (Quantify.)
    
- "How often are meds taken late or missed in a typical week?" (Use to justify PACE med management.)
    

### Objection-handling questions (if they minimize)

- "Why not just keep doing it this way—what would make that work reliably?" (They will surface why it doesn't.)
    
- "What's different now versus six months ago?" (Deterioration proof.)
    

### Closing questions

- "Given the fall risk you shared, are you willing to keep that risk one more month?"
    
- "Ready to have our specialist come out and map a safer plan at home?" (Bridges to intake.)
    

### Follow-up questions

- "Between now and intake, what would make home feel safer—grab-bars, shower chair, med box? Let's list them."

# 3) Reframe coverage & finances around _eliminating surprise bills_ (value > price)

**Why this matters:**  
We've always mentioned the "may be no cost" benefit and referenced the state financial guide, but 2.0 takes it further by tying numbers to lived costs and making the cost of _not_ switching the clearly absurd choice.

### Discovery questions

- "When was the last medical bill that surprised you—what was it for and how much?"
    
- "What do rides to appointments cost you today—money, time off, or favors from family?"
    

### Qualifying questions

- "Which cards do you have now—red/white/blue Medicare, managed care, state Medicaid, VA?"
    
- "All-in monthly income and a ballpark of assets/equity—so I can check if PACE would be free or very low cost."
    

### Objection-handling questions (money/doctors)

- "Why keep your current setup if it keeps producing surprise bills?" (Contrast.)
    
- "What matters more to you: staying with your current doctor or having a coordinated team that keeps you out of the hospital?" (Clarify priorities.)
    

### Closing questions

- "Are you willing to keep risking surprise bills, or are you ready to explore a no-surprise plan?"
    
- "Shall we lock the intake so our specialist can confirm eligibility and run a benefits check?"
    

### Follow-up questions

- "Who else should be looped in for financial documents at intake—POA, spouse, adult children?"

# 4) Multi-thread the "circle of support" early to prevent stalls

**Why this matters:**  
Our "Name the Circle of Support" section has always been solid, but in 2.0 we're moving it earlier in the conversation and using back-and-forth dialogue to surface the real decision-maker, calendar owner, and likely objector before they become blockers.

### Discovery questions

- "Who usually helps you decide about healthcare—what's their role day-to-day?"
    
- "If we schedule, who must be present so we don't have to reschedule later?"
    

### Qualifying questions

- "Does anyone have concerns about day centers, home visits, or changing doctors that we should talk through now?"
    
- "Who controls the calendar for appointments—could we check their availability now?"
    

### Objection-handling questions

- "What specifically would they need to see or hear to feel comfortable?" (Design your intake agenda.)
    
- "If they say 'not now,' why would that be—and what would change that?"
    

### Closing questions

- "Would it help if we text them the two intake options while we're on the line?"
    
- "Are you willing to join a quick 3-way call so we align everyone and pick a time?"
    

### Follow-up questions

- "If they can't make the first intake, what's Plan B we can lock now?" (Always protect momentum.)

# 5) Close with "two options" + "willingness" + prep checklist (commitment >= convenience)

**Why this matters:**  
We've always used the two-option close effectively. Now in 2.0, we're adding the "willingness" tie-down, then immediately assigning simple prep tasks to harden commitment and reduce no-shows.

### Discovery questions (micro-commitments)

- "Before we pick the slot, are you open to gathering IDs and a med list today?"

### Qualifying questions

- "Any pets, stairs, or home safety items we should plan around?"

### Objection-handling questions (scheduling friction)

- "What would make the intake feel easy for you—morning/afternoon, at home vs. center first?"
    
- "If transportation is the worry, would it help that we provide rides with the same drivers?"
    

### Closing questions

- "Here are two options: [Tue 10a] or [Thu 2p]—which works best?"
    
- "Given what you shared, are you willing to take this step so we can stop the [falls/missed meds] spiral?"
    

### Follow-up questions

- "Who should we text the confirmation and prep checklist to—POA, spouse, or both?"
    
- "What would cause you to cancel—and how can we prevent that now?" (Pre-handles no-shows.)

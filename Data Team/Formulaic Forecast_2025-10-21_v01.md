Team,

Please see attached for the updated formula-driven forecast. Note that **conversion rates** now use the **average observed over the trailing four months**, rather than assuming the same conversion rate as the prior month.

The top-line currently shows **260 enrollments** against a **budget of 251**. And **9 of 18** centers are projected to **meet or exceed budget**.

I'll [analyze](https://claude.ai/chat/ca88906a-2f9d-4e99-9d10-09f356dd03c0) the Excel file and screenshot to provide you with insights on this forecast update.
Based on my analysis of the formulaic forecast and screenshot, here are the key insights:

## **📊 Overall Performance**

**Strong Position:** The enterprise is forecasted to achieve **260 enrollments against a budget of 251** (104% attainment) - representing 9 enrollments above target. This maintains the same 104% attainment rate from September.

**Methodology Improvement:** The new forecast uses a **trailing 4-month average conversion rate (53.6%)** rather than assuming the prior month's rate. This provides more stable, data-driven projections.

- **Colorado: 112%** - Solid performance, 9 over budget
- **California: 109%** - On track, 8 over budget
- **New Mexico: 92%** - Slightly below at 8 forecasted vs 9 budgeted

**Regions at Risk (2 of 6):**

- **Virginia: 82%** - 7 enrollments short of budget (33 vs 40)
- **Pennsylvania: 62%** - Significant gap of 6 enrollments (10 vs 16)

## **⭐ Top Performing Centers (9 of 17 at/above 100%)**

1. **Thornton (CO)**: 143% - 6 over budget
2. **Tampa (FL)**: 138% - 5 over budget
3. **Aurora (CO)**: 126% - 3 over budget
4. **San Bernardino (CA)**: 126% - **10 over budget** (biggest absolute contributor)
5. **Denver (CO)**: 119% - 3 over budget
6. **Lakewood (CO)**: 118% - 3 over budget
7. **Sacramento (CA)**: 118% - **6 over budget** (2nd biggest contributor)

## **⚠️ At-Risk Centers Requiring Attention**

**Critical Gaps:**

- **Crenshaw (CA)**: 58% attainment, 5 behind budget
- **Henry Ave (PA)**: 38% attainment, 4 behind budget - **most concerning**
- **Blue Ridge (VA)**: 62% attainment, 4 behind budget
- **Pennypack (PA)**: 72% attainment, 3 behind budget

**Note:** The 5 biggest gaps total **17 enrollments** - these centers represent the primary risk to exceeding budget targets.

## **📈 Key Trends & Observations**

1. **Colorado is the standout region** - All 6 centers are strong, with 4 exceeding budget significantly
    
2. **Pennsylvania needs immediate focus** - Both centers are substantially underperforming (62% and 38%)
    
3. **Strong momentum continues** - The forecast shows growth of 8 enrollments vs. September's actual performance (260 vs 252)
    
4. **Pipeline health**: 274 PPTs anticipated next month with 101 already signed MTD (as of Oct 21)
    
5. **The 4-month trailing average** provides more realistic conversion expectations than the previous month-to-month method

## **💡 Recommended Actions**

1. **Investigate Pennsylvania centers** - Understand root causes of Henry Ave (38%) and Pennypack (72%) underperformance
2. **Support Virginia region** - 3 of 4 centers below budget; may need operational support
3. **Document best practices** from Colorado region to share with struggling centers
4. **Monitor Crenshaw closely** - California's only significantly underperforming center
5. **Leverage strong performers** - San Bernardino and Sacramento are contributing 16 extra enrollments combined

The forecast methodology improvement should provide more reliable predictions going forward, though close monitoring of the 8 underperforming centers will be critical to maintaining the overall 104% attainment rate.

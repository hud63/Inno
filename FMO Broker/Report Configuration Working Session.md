### Broker Portal Reports Configuration

- Current portal: E123 Stream platform
    
- Ready to Sell Report modifications needed:
    
    - Change filter: show “everybody” not just “Ready” status
        
    - Column changes:
        
        - “Agent ID” → “NPN” (National Producer Number)
            
        - “Date Active” → “Date Ready to Sell” (may face pushback - field used across instances)
            
        - Remove “Agent Tree Count” (not applicable until agencies contract)
            
        - Remove “Name of Company” (redundant with other columns)
            
    - Add missing requirements visibility for FMOs to track non-active agents
        
    - Remove “View,” “Delete,” and “Batch” buttons from downline access
        

### Enrollment Status Report Updates

- Column modifications required:
    
    - “Agent Label + ID” → “NPN” throughout
        
    - Keep: agent name, customer ID (application ID number), date of birth
        
    - Maintain: agent parent label (FMO identification)
        
    - “Date Active” clarification needed vs “Date Created”
        
- Inactive reason field shows: declined, did not meet requirements, withdrew

    - Book of business report handles disenrollment reasons separately
        

### Book of Business Report Requirements

    - Current: shows application ID
        
    - Required: member MBI number (Medicare Beneficiary ID on participant card)
        
- Remove “Date Created” field (causes confusion for FMOs)

    - “Date Active/Inactive” → “Effective Date/Termination Date”
        
    - Standard carrier industry language

### Commission Structure and Payment Process

- Payment structure:
    
    - Agents: $250 first year, $200 annual renewals
        
    - FMO hierarchy gets override percentages:
        
        - SGA (Super General Agency): 75% override, should be FMO but aren’t
            
        - MGA (Managing General Agency): 50% override, mid-tier ~50 agents
            
        - GA (General Agency): smaller override, starter level 5-10 agents
            
- E123 payment processing:
    
    - Monthly commission report generation
        
    - Single invoice to InnovAge accounts payable
        
    - Avoids individual payment processing issues
        
- Current status: ~300 contracts signed (very light for launch timing)
    
    - Missed August 15 launch target, went live late September
        
    - Limited FMO rollout participation due to late contracting

        - Significant real estate and campus infrastructure
            
    - Chinese Health Plan - cultural alignment with family care model
        
- Partnership model benefits:

### Meeting Delay and Participants

_Note: This was an informal/in-person meeting where some attendee identities were not fully confirmed_

- Meeting delayed waiting for Nikki (plane landing at 11:30, planned to call in)
    
- Shadi unavailable (showing red status in system) - had been invited but couldn’t join
    
- Anthony available (green status) but wasn’t initially invited to the call
    
- Sean successfully joined and participated in full discussion
    
- Meeting proceeded without full expected attendance
    

### Commission Statements and Reports Development

- Mark and team have been working closely (“tied at the hip”) on commission reporting system
    
- Built comprehensive reporting structure using United Healthcare as benchmark:
    
    - Pulled legitimate United commission statement as foundation
        
    - Used existing agent statement format as template
        
    - Added FMO-specific columns to create separate FMO statements
        
    - Created unified system serving both agents and FMOs
        
- Work completed this morning focused on finalizing report formats
    
- System now provides “legit United statement” equivalent for Innovage operations
    
- Reports designed to handle current application volume (31 total applications across all territories)
    

### Website Updates and Training Access Infrastructure

- Major website enhancement completed with new agent onboarding pathway
    
- Two-site structure implemented:
    
    - Main broker portal for contracted agents (existing)
        
    - External site for non-broker recruitment and training access
        
- New agent tab on [innovage.com](http://innovage.com/) provides:
    
    - Value propositions and company information
        
    - Direct contact form routing to broker support
        
    - Territory-based distribution system (Mark handles distribution)
        
    - Training calendar access for non-contracted agents
        
- Streamlined training access process:
    
    - Agents visit [innovage.com](http://innovage.com/) → click agent tab → access training calendar
        
    - Alternative: direct URL sharing via email
        
    - Removes barriers for agents without broker portal access
        
- Sean implementing consistent Friday training schedule (10-11 AM) regardless of vacation time
    
- Training designed for street recruitment scenario where agents lack portal access
    

### E123 System Issues and Implementation Challenges

- Multiple outstanding system defects without confirmed ETAs:
    
    - State field mandate enforcement during agent account setup (ticket submitted, no ETA)
        
    - ZIP code validation error allowing invalid submissions (ticket submitted this morning)
        
- Commission reporting system adjustments ongoing via email coordination with Tony at E123
    
- Critical status reporting functionality delayed:
    
    - Automated feeds not functioning properly
        
    - Waiting on Cody for system completion
        
    - Tony’s estimate: Wednesday next week completion (unofficial timeline)
        
    - Requires continued manual workarounds until automated system operational
        
- Implementation call scheduled immediately after this meeting to potentially secure ETAs
    

### Agent Communication and Application Status Management

- Manual status communication process implemented due to system limitations
    
- Current application volume: 31 total applications requiring individual status updates
    
- Territory management approach:
    
    - Sherry: Colorado and New Mexico (no broker manager assigned)
        
    - Sean: California territory (4 active applications)
        
- Detailed status update examples documented:
    
    - Dorothy’s territory: 2 closed applications
        
        - Marlin Iverson: Closed - no ADLs beyond type 2 diabetes, lacks Medi-Cal/Medicare
            
        - Client withdrew application due to doctor change concerns
            
    - Qualification issues: ADL documentation requirements not met during verification calls
        
    - Service area problems: E123 accepted application from non-covered ZIP code
        
- Process requires cross-referencing enrollment status reports with Alan’s lead views
    
- Color-coding system implemented for tracking completion status
    
- Agent education component: training Dorothy on proper ADL documentation for applications
    

### Duplicate Application Issues and System Gaps

- Critical system deficiency identified: duplicate status closures lack explanation
    
- Arnaldo case study: application marked “duplicate” without showing original record
    
- Potential scenarios creating confusion:
    
    - Existing member attempts new enrollment
        
    - Family member applications (wife wanting to join after spouse)
        
    - Broker credit attribution disputes
        
- Current system shows closure code “duplicate” but provides no supporting documentation
    
- Creates communication challenges with brokers requiring detailed explanations
    
- Steven identified as subject matter expert for complex cases requiring system navigation
    

### Risks and Dependencies

- E123 automated feed delays requiring continued manual workarounds through Wednesday next week (estimated)
    
- Duplicate application closure process lacks transparency, creating broker communication challenges
    
- ZIP code validation defect allows invalid applications to enter system, requiring manual closure and agent notification
    
- Dependency on Cody for status reporting completion with no firm delivery commitment
    
- Manual status update process unsustainable long-term given increasing application volume
    

### Action Items

- Mark: Execute additional ad hoc enrollment status report Monday before anticipated Wednesday system launch
    
- Sean: Complete California agent status notifications using demonstrated template and cross-reference process
    
- Mark/Tony: Address duplicate application status visibility and documentation gaps in E123 system
    
- Team: Monitor Wednesday deadline for automated status reporting implementation

### Tony Robbins Discussion & Personal Development

- Mark expressed appreciation for help with date mistake during UKG system transition
    
- Positive reframing approach discussed
    
    - UKG system gap discovery viewed as opportunity for fixes
        
    - “This is their chance to fix it” mentality
        
    - Tony Robbins influence on maintaining positive disposition
        
- Tony Robbins event experiences and training
    
    - Five different people recommended live events as “absolutely worth every penny”
        
    - Attended sales training with Eli Wild (Robbins’ top salesperson)
        
    - Training approach described as deeply psychological - “saving people from suicide thing”
        
    - Different methodology that “really works” through emotional connection tracking
        
    - Netflix documentary from ~4 years ago profiled live events and individual transformations
        
- Personal development insights
    
    - Discussion on compartmentalization vs. holistic approach
        
    - “Nothing is compartmentalized” - positive changes spill over into all life areas
        
    - Deep psychological work creates broad positive impact across different domains
        

### UAT Testing & User Hierarchy Setup

- Three distinct user experiences required for testing: FMO, Agency, Agent
    
- Agent signup page UAT testing as primary focus
    
- Link distribution challenges identified
    
    - FMOs need two separate link versions: agencies vs. direct broker signups
        
    - Agencies need dedicated link for signing up their downline agents
        
    - URL parameter tagging strongly preferred over user selection fields
        
    - Rationale: “foolproof” system avoids user error and missing data
        
    - Fallback option: required fields when agents use agency links
        
- Hierarchy structure clarification needed
    
    - Current system shows agent and agency permissions as nearly identical
        
    - Confirmed: no agency-to-agency signup capability needed
        
    - Focus on “bottom rung plus one rung up plus top rung of ladder”
        
    - Multiple potential layers exist but only specific rungs required for CRM integration
        
- Development team coordination issues
    
    - Sherry unavailable for immediate consultation call
        
    - Frustration expressed with E123 as “order takers” vs. “Sherpa” guidance
        
    - E123 not leveraging experience from other clients effectively
        
- Decision: Schedule live testing session with Sherry and development team for critical hierarchy setup
    

### Commission Report Requirements & Structure

- Agency field integration requirements
    
    - Must be added to all commission reports, statements, and back office views
        
    - FMO reconciliation dependency: need to track which agency produced enrollments
        
    - Enable FMO downline payment calculations for internal commission processes
        
    - Specific portal link referenced for commission tab usage patterns
        
- Commission schedule timing corrections identified
    
    - Current example shows December enrollment with January renewal payment (incorrect)
        
    - Corrected approach: renewal payments in same calendar month as original enrollment
        
    - Example provided: 12/01/2025 enrollment → 12/01/2026 renewal payment distributed in December 2026
        
    - Logic: first of month enrollment guarantees full month coverage, no mid-month proration
        
    - Issue likely stems from E123 templates based on clients with proration models
        
- Back office functionality gaps
    
    - All commission reports, statements, and views require agent/agency/FMO detail integration
        
    - Consistent customer demand for on-demand reporting vs. end-of-month portal statements
        
    - FMOs and agencies expected to pull CSV files and use commission tabs frequently
        
    - Current system responses inadequate: “they get it in their portal at end of month”
        

### Next Steps

- Submit formal request to include agency field in all FMO and agency lists/reports with E123 terminology
    
- Schedule live hierarchy testing session with Sherry and development team to avoid translation issues
    
- Submit commission schedule timing adjustments with detailed rationale and corrected examples
    
- Copy both Mark and team member on updated requirements documentation
    
- Follow up on accounts payable team non-responsiveness for invoice processing
    
- Prepare for additional meetings as UAT testing progresses

### Commission Payment Structure Clarification

- Renewal payment timing resolved: Must align with original commission calendar month
    
- Technical clarification on service periods:
    
    - Example: December 1, 2025 enrollment through November 30, 2026 (full 12 months)
        
    - December 1, 2026 becomes 13th month of service
        
    - Renewal payment issued in December 2026 commission cycle
        
- Payment trigger: Participant must be actively enrolled on first day of month for full capitation
    
- Consistency requirement: Language must match broker handbook terminology exactly
    

### E123 Commission System Integration Issues

- Multiple systemic problems identified in commission reporting:
    
    - Product enrollment/fee type fields inappropriate for commission-only searches
        
    - Field naming conventions don’t match industry carrier standards
        
    - Missing agency/FMO identification columns across all reports and list views
        
- Specific technical gaps:
    
    - Cannot distinguish between FMO vs agent commissions in current format
        
    - Posted type should be “effective date”
        
    - Type field should specify “initial/renewal/chargeback” not internal codes
        
    - Payee field unclear and non-standard
        
- UnitedHealthcare commission statement successfully obtained as industry reference
    
    - Excel export functionality confirmed broken (PDF export working)
        
    - Statement provides proper field structure and naming conventions
        
- FMO reporting requirements: Need additional columns for agency affiliations and downline payment visibility
    

### Service Area and Application Processing

- Critical system flaw identified: ZIP code validation not functioning properly
    
    - Non-covered ZIP codes (80015, 80016 in Colorado) allowing application submission
        
    - Applications should terminate before participant form loads for non-service areas
        
    - E123 provided ZIP code list but validation not properly implemented
        
- Geographic expansion limitations explained:
    
    - CMS approval required for new service areas through annual bidding process
        
    - California’s advantageous position: No income/asset limitations for Medi-Cal eligibility
        
    - LA County: Tier 4 reimbursement rate supporting 33+ PACE providers
        
    - Other states have tiered reimbursement affecting program viability
        

### Technology and System Issues

- UHC portal access complications requiring multiple authentication steps
    
- Outlook functionality problems affecting email cursor navigation
    
- Commission statement access process time-intensive but ultimately successful
    
- E123 system requiring terminology updates throughout platform
    

### Next Steps and Action Items

- Schedule comprehensive call with E123 to review commission report field structure and implementation
    
- Provide UHC commission statement as formatting reference for industry standard compliance
    
- Update all system terminology from “clawback” to “chargeback” for agent/FMO clarity
    
- Resolve ZIP code validation issues preventing non-service area applications
    
- Address Excel export functionality for commission reports
    
- Follow up on Colorado EFT partner resolution to determine upside potential
    
- Investigate “previous insurance” preference reasoning for Crenshaw disenrollments
    
- Continue options counseling efforts in San Bernardino to minimize disenrollments

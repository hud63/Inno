    - OC entity code
    - Entity description (added for readability/support purposes)

    - Field naming convention: likely “IVG_NPN”
    - Current status: NPN captured at member level but not transmitted via API
    - Action required: Cody to create field, API update to follow

    - Testing dependent on API Part 2 completion

### Hierarchy & Access Control Updates
- Password elimination strategy in progress
    - Links and dropdown menus replacing manual password entry
    - Access controls based on user hierarchy level:
        - FMOs: see agents, agencies, and LOAs
        - Agencies: see agent links only
        - Agents: see personal information only, no additional links
- LOA (Letter of Authorization) considerations confirmed
    - LOAs still exist in current business model
    - Some agencies operate as LOA shops under larger FMOs

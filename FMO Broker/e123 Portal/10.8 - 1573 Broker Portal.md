# 10.8 - 1573 Broker Portal

Wed, 08 Oct 25

### Priority System Reorganization

- Restructured entire priority list with new numbering system based on critical path analysis
    
    - Priority 1: Hierarchy changes - Troy and Shire have marching orders, talking internally
        
    - Priority 2: Two API items - call scheduled Tuesday 11:30 AM CT (9:30 AM Tony’s time)
        
    - Priority 3: All password-related fixes and static link maintenance grouped together
        
- Scheduled follow-up call with Sherry tomorrow (labeled as front-end website work)
    
- Cody marked out of office Friday but showed as “free” - caused scheduling conflict
    
    - Rescheduled API call from Friday to Tuesday 11:30 AM CT
        
    - Note: Cody needs to properly block calendar as “out of office” not “show free”
        

### Current Development Status & Testing

- Items completed and ready for testing:
    
    - Export all lists to Excel functionality - Mark to test
        
    - Progress made on blank screen issue resolution
        
    - Sales and marketing resources link to broker resources - needs user testing
        
- Currently in development:
    
    - Reset password functionality
        
    - Blank screen issue fix
        
- Priority groupings established:
    
    - Applications: All grouped as Priority 10 (previously scattered as 10, 14, etc.)
        
    - Commissions: All grouped as Priority 6 for dedicated call next week
        
    - Test data cleanup: Priority 25 (after Shire completes dev work and testing)
        

### System Enhancement Requirements

- Dashboard view gap identified between admin and user portals
    
    - Screenshot provided showing admin view with upper-right dashboard numbers
        
    - FMO users missing these dashboard statistics that Mark sees as admin
        
    - Shire needs clarification on what users see vs. what should be exposed
        
- File upload functionality added as Priority 14 due to long-standing request
    
    - Manual workflow required: security team prohibits automated virus scanning
        
    - Process: email notification → attachment page link → manual download → CRM upload
        
    - David Gomez designated as primary BSU for handling manual uploads
        
    - Initially Mark will handle to ensure process works correctly
        
- Footer contact information changes needed on contracts
    
    - Currently shows Sherry’s contact info at bottom of contracts
        
    - Decision: Remove Sherry info, add FMO information instead
        
    - Goal: Clients should see FMO they’re contracting with, not backend contact
        

### Application Portal & User Features

- Consumer-facing portal discussed with Troy yesterday - sequenced appropriately
    
- Banking information entry capability assigned Priority 21 for front-end portal
    
- FMO back office enhancement: Enable quick copy/paste of downline contracts
    
    - User story needed from Mark’s team
        
    - Connected to Priority 1 hierarchy work - all intertwined features
        
- Email template updates for agent onboarding:
    
    - Add language recommending users save /manage URL to favorites
        
    - Interim solution until password/static link issues resolved (Priority 3.1)
        
- Access setup: New hires (Mark’s team) need admin-level access like Mark
    

### Next Steps

- Miguel: Work with Shire and team to provide ETAs for all prioritized items
    
- Mark: Test export-to-Excel functionality and other completed features
    
- Follow-up with Sherry on agent welcome email template completion status
    
- Commission team call scheduled for next week covering all Priority 6 items
    
- Tuesday 11:30 AM CT: API call with rescheduled attendees
    
- David Gomez onboarding for manual file upload process handling
    

### Open Questions / Risks

- Password/link interim email template copy - status unclear, needs Sherry confirmation
    
- File attachment security constraints prevent automation - ongoing manual overhead required
    
- Test data proliferation issue - Sherry adding test cases daily despite cleanup requests
    
- User story format requirements - Mark’s team unfamiliar with technical documentation standards
    
- Timeline dependencies between hierarchy changes and related FMO portal features

### Current Market Disruption & PACE Opportunity

- 2025 AEP described as “most disruptive in history”
    
    - National carriers exiting markets completely
        
    - Service area reductions across the board
        
    - PPOs “pretty much nationally off the shelves”
        
    - Carriers going non-commission if staying in market
        
    - Plan exits, H-codes elimination, formulary narrowing
        
    - IPA/medical group “divorces” from insurance companies
        
- Traditional client journey path:
    
    - T65 campaigns → healthy enrollees in Med Sup or zero-premium MAPDs
        
    - Aging → more chronically ill, fixed income, medications increase
        
    - Become Medicaid eligible → enrolled in DSNPs with subpar networks
        
    - Fall through cracks due to lack of coordination → PACE eligibility
        
- CMS designated PACE as “gold standard of healthcare”
    
    - Previously didn’t allow broker partnerships
        
    - 4-5 years ago opened to broker channel due to MA disruption
        
- Innovage’s previous broker attempt failed due to lack of experience/leadership

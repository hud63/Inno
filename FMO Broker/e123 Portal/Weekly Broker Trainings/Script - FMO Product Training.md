Of course. Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step plan based on the presentation, designed to help you understand and implement the InnovAge PACE program into your brokerage.

### **Part 1: Understanding the Foundation - Why PACE & InnovAge?**

This section covers the market context and the core mission behind the program, which is crucial for framing your conversations with clients.

**1. Acknowledge the Current Medicare Market Crisis:**
The traditional Medicare Advantage and carrier space is facing significant challenges that create an opportunity for a different solution like PACE. When speaking with clients or colleagues, understand these pain points:
*   **Carrier Instability:** National carriers are experiencing plan exits, reductions-in-force (RIFs), and service area reductions (SARs).
*   **Declining Quality:** Star ratings are dropping, and benefit packages are being "trimmed down" (e.g., smaller formularies, reduced benefits).
*   **Network Issues:** Provider networks are shrinking, leading to clients being unable to see their doctors after a plan change. This is especially true for D-SNP plans, which often have sub-par networks and can lead to members being "divorced" from their IPA/Medical Groups.
*   **Poor Service:** Heavy reliance on offshore call centers has led to a dramatic decrease in the level of service, creating frustration for both brokers and members.

**2. Embrace the PACE Mission Statement:**
The core philosophy of PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly) is simple but powerful. It is the central selling point.
*   **Mission:** To keep frail, nursing-home-eligible seniors living safely and independently in their own homes for as long as possible.
*   **Key Question to Ask Prospects:** "If you had the choice, would you rather go to a long-term care facility or stay in your own home?" The answer will almost always be "stay home," which opens the door to a PACE conversation.

**3. Understand Who InnovAge Is:**
InnovAge is not a new startup; they are the established leader in the PACE space.
*   **The Oldest & Largest:** Operating for over 35 years.
*   **Multi-State Operation:** Licensed and operating in California (NorCal & SoCal), Colorado (headquarters), New Mexico, Florida, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.
*   **A True Carrier:** InnovAge holds direct contracts with both Medicare and the state's Medicaid program to administer all member benefits, including medical, health, and long-term care services.

### **Part 2: The InnovAge Value Proposition - What You're Offering**

This is the "what." It details the unique, integrated model that differentiates PACE from any other plan.

**1. The All-in-One Center Model:**
Think of the InnovAge center as a "Kaiser Permanente for seniors." Nearly all of a member's needs are met under one roof. This includes:
*   **Medical Clinic:** Staffed with primary care physicians who are geriatric specialists, RNs, LVNs, and medical assistants. The patient-to-provider ratio is extremely low (around 98-to-1 vs. 2500-to-1 in traditional plans), allowing for hour-long appointments.
*   **Dental Clinic:** Full-service dental care in-house.
*   **Vision Department:** Eye exams, glasses, and contacts.
*   **Audiology Department:** Hearing tests and hearing aids.
*   **Podiatry (Foot Care):** Kept in-house due to high demand in the senior population.
*   **Physical, Occupational, and Speech Therapy Center:** A large, dedicated area for rehabilitation.
*   **Mental Health Services:** In-house psychology, counseling, and nutritional counseling.
*   **Adult Day Center:** A place for social engagement, activities, and meals.
*   **In-house Pharmacy:** Handling all prescription drug needs.

**2. The Power of the Interdisciplinary Team (IDT):**
Every single member is assigned their own dedicated 11-person care team. This team meets every morning to discuss their members' cases and create a proactive, individualized care plan. This eliminates the client falling through the cracks. The team includes:
*   Primary Care Physician (PCP)
*   Registered Nurse (RN)
*   Social Worker (the "mama bear" and single point of contact for the family)
*   Physical & Occupational Therapists
*   Dietitian
*   Home Care Coordinator
*   Personal Care Attendant
*   Driver
*   And others.

**3. Key Program Features & Benefits:**
*   **No Formularies:** InnovAge owns its own pharmacy. The doctor prescribes whatever medication the patient needs. There are no step therapies or complex prior authorizations for drugs.
*   **No OTC Limits:** Members receive the over-the-counter items they need without a restrictive flex card or allowance.
*   **Transportation Included:** A large fleet of vehicles provides unlimited, door-to-door transportation to the InnovAge center and any external specialist appointments.
*   **In-Home Support (IHSS):** Task-based services are provided in the member's home, including cleaning, laundry, showering assistance, etc.
*   **Long-Term Care Coordination:** If a member can no longer live safely at home, the social worker manages the entire process of placing them in a contracted assisted living or skilled nursing facility. This takes the immense burden off the family.

### **Part 3: Prospecting - Identifying Your Ideal InnovAge Candidate**

This is the "who." There are three distinct profiles to look for. Enrollment is open 12 months a year for all of them.

**Candidate Profile #1: The Dual-Eligible (The Lowest Hanging Fruit)**
*   **Age:** 65 or older.
*   **Benefits:** Has Medicare A & B.
*   **Financial:** Is *currently enrolled* in their state's Medicaid program (e.g., Medi-Cal).
*   **Living Situation:** Lives in a covered service area (zip code specific) in stable housing (apartment, rented room, home, etc.).
*   **Needs:** Requires assistance with two or more Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), such as needing help opening a jar, doing laundry, bathing, etc.

**Candidate Profile #2: The "At-Risk" Senior (Pre-Medicaid Eligible)**
*   **Age:** 55 or older.
*   **Financial:** Is *not* currently on Medicaid, but you believe they would financially qualify based on their low income and assets.
*   **Living Situation:** Lives in a covered service area in stable housing.
*   **Needs:** Requires assistance with two or more ADLs.
*   **Action:** Submit the application. The InnovAge Financial Enrollment Rep will work with you and the applicant to get them qualified for the state's Medicaid long-term care benefits.

**Candidate Profile #3: The Qualified Veteran**
*   **This profile has NO Medicare or Medicaid requirement.**
*   **Age:** 55 or older.
*   **Living Situation:** Lives in a covered service area.
*   **VA Status:** Has a VA service-connected disability rating of 70% or greater.
*   **Action:** The VA will pay InnovAge for the member's care. They do not lose their VA coverage.

### **Part 4: The Step-by-Step Enrollment Process**

This is the "how-to." It is different from a standard MA enrollment and requires managing client expectations on the timeline.

*   **Step 1: Submit the Online Application.** All applications are electronic via your broker portal. You do not need to submit an SOA.
*   **Step 2: Verification Call.** InnovAge will call the applicant to verify their information and intent to enroll. Prepare your client for this call.
*   **Step 3: The In-Home Assessment (The "Underwriting").** An InnovAge nurse will visit the applicant's home to:
    *   Conduct a health and risk assessment.
    *   Review their medical history.
    *   Assess their home for safety modifications (e.g., need for handrails, shower chair).
*   **Step 4: The IDT Care Plan.** The nurse presents their findings to the 11-person Interdisciplinary Team (IDT), which then develops a preliminary care plan.
*   **Step 5: State Approval.** InnovAge submits the application and assessment to the state for final approval. This is the longest part of the process and can take anywhere from **30 to 90 days**, depending on the state (New Mexico is the slowest).
*   **Step 6: Enrollment Confirmation & Effective Date.** Once the state approves, InnovAge submits the enrollment to CMS. The client's enrollment becomes effective the first of the following month. **CMS does not allow retro-enrollments.**

**Important Note:** The client **does not lose their current coverage** during this process. They remain on their existing plan until the InnovAge enrollment is approved and becomes effective.

### **Part 5: Your Broker Toolkit - Operations, Compliance & Commissions**

This covers the essential details for you, the broker.

**1. Getting Contracted & Certified:**
*   The process is simple and electronic. Your FMO or InnovAge will send you a digital contract.
*   You will need to upload your DOI license and proof of E&O insurance ($1M/$1M).
*   The certification is a very short, painless online module that takes about 10-15 minutes.

**2. Using the Broker Portal:**
This is your central hub. It contains:
*   **Sales Resource Tab:** This is critical. Download the certification deck here, which contains the state-specific ADL point charts. You will also find co-brandable marketing flyers and other materials.
*   **Back Office Tab:** This is for your business operations, including:
    *   Commission Statements
    *   Book of Business Reports
    *   Enrollment Status Reports

**3. Compliance Best Practices (The "CYA" Guide):**
While InnovAge's requirements are minimal, you should still follow best practices to protect yourself.
*   **Scope of Appointment (SOA):** InnovAge does not require you to submit an SOA. However, it is **highly recommended** that you complete one and keep it in your files for every appointment.
*   **Call Recording:** InnovAge does not require a voice-recorded call. However, if you are selling over the phone, it is **highly recommended** that you record the call for your own protection.
*   **Event Filing:** You do not need to file marketing or sales events with InnovAge.

**4. Understanding Your Compensation:**
*   **Commissions:** You are paid Fair Market Value (FMV) for your state for both initial and renewal commissions.
*   **Payment:** Payments are made via direct deposit in the third week of the month following the enrollment's effective date.
*   **FMOs:** If you are with an FMO, InnovAge pays the FMO an override and pays you your full commission directly. Your commissions are not assigned.
*   **Renewals:** Renewals are advanced in a single lump sum payment on the 13th month of the member's anniversary.
*   **Chargebacks:** A standard 9-month chargeback policy applies to initial commissions. The new policy is that **there will be no chargebacks on renewals.**

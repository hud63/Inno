### E123 Technical Issues Status

- Three ongoing system problems being tracked:
    
    - Application loading: Remove HTTP and WWW workaround still required
        
    - Lead transfer to CRM: Fixed yesterday, taking effect today
        
    - Password reset: No updates since yesterday at 2:22pm
        
- Tony/Mark call scheduled in 15 minutes to address remaining issues
    
- Mark attending daily calls with Tony for broader system updates
    

### Escrow Account Funding

- Tony working with Angela to fund escrow account
    
- Mark provided calculation for 100 enrollments to cover through December 31
    
- Based on California initial premiums for safety buffer
    
- Funding expected today per system updates
    

### Commission Reporting Updates

- Currently manual commission and override reports being generated
    
- No timeline yet for automated FMO downline commission reports
    
- Angela making changes to commission structure but details unclear
    

### Broker Support Phone System Fix

- Morning outage: No one answering broker support calls
    
- Root cause: David (first in queue) starts 10am Pacific, Mark switched to unfamiliar system
    
- Resolution implemented:
    
    - Automatic routing with no hold time between agents
        
    - Order: David → Mark → Inside Sales → Voicemail
        
    - Mark returned to Teams system until properly trained on new platform
        
- Verification line tested and working properly (separate from broker support issue)
    

### Team Structure Changes

- Mark designated as E123 subject matter expert
    
    - Currently in E123 training program
        
    - Handling pending/missing information cases
        
    - Twice daily sweeps (morning/afternoon)
        
    - Has Activate access per Angela
        
- David added as part-time hybrid role:
    
    - Supporting both Mark and inside sales
        
    - Training alongside Mark on E123 systems
        
    - 99% of current calls E123-related (contracting, applications, portal access)
        
- Future training needed: PACE product knowledge for sales support
    

### Next Steps

- Mark to be primary E123 contact for internal issues
    
- Steven/Sean to connect directly with Mark for E123 needs
    
- Gradual transition away from E123 dependency
    
- Mark’s printer order to be followed up

Of course. Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step guide based on the meeting, detailing how to implement the processes discussed.

### **Phase 1: Initial FMO Onboarding & Welcome Email**

Upon successful contracting as an FMO, you will receive a welcome email from `BrokerSupport@innovage.com`. This email is the starting point for managing your agents and accessing the portal.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Locate the Welcome Email:** Find the email with the subject line "Your InnovAge FMO portal account is now activated".
2.  **Save the Portal Link:** The email contains a critical link to your back-office account. It is recommended to save this link as a favorite in your browser for easy access.
    *   **Portal URL:** `https://broker.innovage.com/manage`
3.  **Identify Your Unique Agent Contracting Links:** The email provides two distinct URLs for onboarding your downline agents. These links are unique to your FMO and will automatically place new agents under your hierarchy.
    *   **To invite a standard 1099 independent agent (street level):**
        *   Use the link labeled **"Invite Broker"**.
        *   **URL:** `https://application.innovage.com/agents/signup.cfm?id=899685&code=sega`
    *   **To invite an agent under a Letter of Agreement (LOA), where commissions are paid to the agency/FMO:**
        *   Use the link labeled **"Invite LOA"**.
        *   **URL:** `https://application.innovage.com/agents/signup.cfm?id=899685&code=janet`
    *   **Note:** The `id=899685` in the URL is your unique FMO identifier. The `code=` parameter determines the contract type.

    *   After watching the video, return to the sign-up form.
    *   Answer the 10 multiple-choice certification questions. A passing score of 85% is required (a maximum of one incorrect answer is allowed).

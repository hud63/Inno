### **Tips for Delivery:**

*   **Be Personal:** The original presenter, Sheri Hernandez, effectively uses her personal story about her mother to connect with the audience and demonstrate the real-world value of the PACE program. Consider sharing a brief, relevant personal story if you have one, or use her story as a powerful example.
*   **Be an Expert:** She confidently explains the current chaotic state of the Medicare Advantage market. This positions her as an insider who understands the brokers' pain points and presents PACE as a stable, valuable solution.
*   **Keep it Conversational:** Use a friendly and engaging tone. Ask rhetorical questions and pause to let points sink in.

### **Slide: The Value in Representing InnovAge PACE**

"Good morning, everybody. My name is Sheri Hernandez, and I am the National Broker Channel Sales Director for InnovAge.

For those of you who don’t know me, I’m actually really new to the company. I just started on June 2nd, so it's been a little over three months.

To give you some background on how I got here, I have always worked for the Medicare carriers—primarily in the Medicare Advantage and Med Supp space for all the big ones like Aetna, Humana, etc. I most recently left Molina Healthcare.

I made the decision to leave because after 28 years of working for the carriers, specializing in Medicare Advantage, D-SNPs, and C-SNPs, I've seen a lot of changes. The last five years, in particular, have been brutal, not only for the carriers but especially for the agents.

In my opinion, this is probably one of the worst AEPs I've ever seen. I thought it would get better, but we're experiencing so much abrasion and turbulence across the board. Nationally, this is the most disruptive AEP in history. This is because there are a lot of legislative and CMS changes affecting the market. You're seeing:

*   National carriers completely exiting markets or doing massive service area reductions.
*   PPO plans are pretty much coming off the shelves nationally.
*   A ton of carriers are going non-commission if they are staying in the market.
*   Huge reductions in benefits as carriers are 'trimming the fat,' especially with prescription drug formularies, which are narrowing or moving to a single tier in the D-SNP market.
*   And finally, something I don't want to forget because there's a lot of pain around this in places like Florida, is the 'divorces' between insurance companies and the medical groups or IPAs they contract with. A lot of these IPAs are no longer profitable, leading to major network disruptions.

It is a storm out there right now, and we're hoping to be that calm in your storm.

My journey here is also personal. I knew about PACE, as many of us do from our annual AHIP training, but I didn't really know what it was. For a long time, CMS didn't even allow PACE programs to work with brokers. A few years back, CMS saw the disruption in the Medicare Advantage space and started pushing PACE programs, which they call the 'gold standard of healthcare,' to work with brokers like you.

InnovAge tried this a few years ago but didn't have the experienced leadership for the broker channel to make it work. That's where my story comes in.

During my time at Molina, my mom, who has Alzheimer's, dementia, and COPD, was really sick. She's a dual-eligible individual, so I put her on a Medi-Medi plan, just like most of us would. But she eventually fell through the cracks. The system just wasn't working for her complex needs.

Most seniors want to stay at home, right? If you ask your clients, 'Do you want to go into a facility, or would you rather stay at home?' 100% of them will say they want to stay home.

So I did some research on PACE and I found InnovAge as a consumer. My mom has been with InnovAge, and they helped keep her at home safely with my stepdad for as long as possible. When the time came that she needed more care, her social worker and her care team helped transition her. She's still with InnovAge and doing great. I'm so grateful to them.

You can see how it all came full circle. I knew InnovAge, they knew me, and voilà, here I am. I'm really proud of the commitment the company has made. In just three months, we've been able to completely rehab the system and pull together a viable FMO and broker channel that is mirrored identically to the Medicare Advantage plans.

I'm excited, and I hope you are too. So today, we're going to talk about InnovAge, how PACE works, and where it fits into your portfolio."

### **Slide: Our Mission Statement**

"As you can see here, our mission statement is exactly what my mom's story is. The mission of all PACE programs is the same: to enable seniors to live life on their terms—by aging in place, in their own homes and communities, for as long as safely possible. That’s it. That's our mission, and we provide the resources to do that."

***

### **Slide: Who is InnovAge?**

"So who are we? InnovAge has been around for over 35 years; we're the oldest and the largest PACE operator in the country.

We currently operate in six states:

*   **On the West Coast:** California, Colorado, and Albuquerque, New Mexico. In some of these areas, we're the only PACE program, or the only one that works with brokers and pays street-level commissions.
*   **On the East Coast:** Florida, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

To set the stage, InnovAge and all PACE programs operate under a three-way contract. We have a contract with CMS, just like any Medicare Advantage carrier, to provide Medicare benefits and Part D. But we also have a contract with the state's Medicaid program (or Medi-Cal in California) to provide their Medicaid health benefits. The key difference between us and a traditional D-SNP is that we also hold the contract for **long-term care**. That way, everything is wrapped into one seamless plan."

***

### **Slide: California Service Area**

"For California, in Northern California, we have our Sacramento service center. Sacramento County is a full county, and we have partial coverage in El Dorado County, going up to Placerville. We cover all of Placer County, and have partial coverage in San Joaquin, Sutter, and Yuba counties.

For Southern California, we are in the Inland Empire (San Bernardino and Riverside counties) and we have our Crenshaw center, which services parts of Los Angeles County.

We are always expanding. In 2026, pending DHCS approval, we'll be opening in Kern County (Bakersfield) and Downey, which is another area in Los Angeles County.

A key thing to remember for all states is that our service areas are filed with CMS by zip code. We provide a detailed zip code lookup tool in the broker portal to make it simple for you."

***

### **Slide: Colorado Service Area**

"Colorado is our home state! We started here 35 years ago and have a very strong presence. We have six centers here: Loveland, Denver, Lakewood, Thornton, Aurora, and Pueblo. These centers service several counties, including Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Denver, Jefferson, Larimer, Pueblo, and Weld.

If you're new to us in Colorado, I highly encourage you to reach out to your broker manager and set up a time to tour one of these beautiful facilities. It will really bring the program to life."

***

### **Slide: New Mexico Service Area**

"In New Mexico, we are the only PACE program. Our service area is centered around our Albuquerque location." *(Presenter Note: If your audience has no brokers in this state, you can move through this slide quickly.)*

***

### **Slide: Florida Service Area**

"For my Floridians, InnovAge is a hot commodity in your market. Our centers there are absolutely spectacular and grand.

We have two main service areas. In Orlando, we partner with Orlando Health, one of the largest healthcare systems there. We cover Lake, Orange, Osceola, and Seminole counties. In Tampa, we partner with Tampa General and its physicians, and we cover Hernando, Hillsborough, and Pasco counties."

***

### **Slide: Philadelphia Service Area**

"In Philadelphia, we have four centers: Pennypack, St. Barts, Allegheny, and Henry Ave. We don't have as many zip codes here as in some other states, but it's a strong market with plenty of opportunity. Be sure to reach out to your broker manager, Steven, for specific details on marketing in this area."

***

### **Slide: Virginia Service Area**

"In Virginia, we have a great grasp on the state with four centers: the Peninsula (Richmond area), Richmond proper, Blue Ridge, and Roanoke. You can see the extensive list of zip codes we cover.

However, Virginia is a bit tougher to qualify for. While most states require a member to have at least two Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), Virginia requires the equivalent of five. Don't be discouraged, though. It’s based on a point system, and we provide tools to help you assess this. We get a lot of people approved, so it's a very popular and viable market."

### **Slide: PACE is positioned towards the end of the healthcare continuum**

"This is my favorite slide because it shows exactly where we fit in. As brokers, we walk our clients through their healthcare journey.

They might start with Commercial insurance, then they turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare. At that point, they're often healthier, and we put them on a Med Supp or a shiny, zero-premium MAPD plan.

But as time goes on, they get older, more chronically ill, their income may decrease, and they might become eligible for Medicaid. This is when they become a 'Medi-Medi' or D-SNP client.

But eventually, for many, even the D-SNP stops working. They fall through the cracks due to a lack of care coordination, subpar networks, or because they need more help to stay at home.

That's where we come in. The orange bubble on this chart is PACE. We become the solution when they need that next level of coordinated, long-term care."

***

### **Slide: PACE is different than a conventional health plan.**

"This slide shows the key differences. A traditional health plan secures a license, builds a provider network by contracting with outside groups, and then the members are left to advocate for their own care.

PACE is completely different. We build our own integrated ecosystem. We have our own PACE Centers, our own transportation fleet, and a dedicated, 11-member interdisciplinary care team (IDT) that manages and advocates for each participant. We provide care through the end of life."

***

### **Slide: Broker Enrollment Timeline**

"This timeline shows how the process works. The enrollment process is very similar to writing a life insurance application. Because we have to submit an application to the state for long-term care approval, it takes longer—about 30-45 days.

The only way to submit an application is online through your broker portal. We do not participate with Connecture or Sunfire, and there are no paper applications.

Here's the step-by-step process:
1.  **Application Submitted:** You submit the application online via the portal.
2.  **Verification Call:** This is crucial. After submitting, you must complete a three-way verification call with your client to confirm their information and ADLs.
3.  **Intake Appointment:** We schedule an intake with the client.
4.  **Enrollment Rep & Nurse Review:** Our reps and nurses begin the financial and clinical assessments.
5.  **IDT Care Plan:** The nurse brings the assessment to the Interdisciplinary Team, and they develop the personalized care plan.
6.  **State Application:** We submit the signed enrollment application to the state for LTC approval.
7.  **CMS Submission & Approval:** Once the state approves, we submit it to CMS for the final plan changeover.

The effective date is always the first of the following month after CMS approval, just like an MAPD. There are no retro-effective dates."

### **Slide: Who's a good candidate for PACE?**

"So, who qualifies? The great news is that PACE has a Continuous Special Enrollment Period (SEP), so you can enroll clients all year long.

There are three main scenarios:
1.  **Person Age 65+:** This is your low-hanging fruit, your typical Medi-Medi client. They are on Medicare, have Medicaid (or are eligible), have stable housing, and need help with two or more Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). They can have Medicare Part A, Part B, or both.
2.  **Person Age 55+:** This person is 55 or older and may not have Medicare yet. As long as they have Medicaid (or qualify for it) and meet the ADL and housing requirements, we can enroll them. Our teams are skilled at helping them apply for Medicaid if needed.
3.  **Military Veteran Age 55+:** This is for veterans 55 and older who have a 70% or greater service-connected disability. This has nothing to do with Medicare or Medicaid. The VA pays InnovAge directly for their care, so there's no cost to the veteran. They do not lose their VA benefits.

For all scenarios, the participant **must** reside in a zip code served by InnovAge."

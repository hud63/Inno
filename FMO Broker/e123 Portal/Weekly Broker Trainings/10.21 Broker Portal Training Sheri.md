    - IT settings prevent sharing outside Innovation Health organization
        
    - Quality issues described as “janky” by Mark

    - Tony’s budget approval likely given his support for AI tools
        
    - Would benefit both broker support and rev ops training initiatives
        
    - Mark preparing detailed email with full feature breakdown
        

### Critical Issues and Action Items

    - Creates conflict with broker channel strategy
        
    - Must be eliminated from all broker-facing materials
        
- Commission attribution policy clarification needed:
    
    - Issue arose during CRM technical discussion yesterday
        
    - Scenario: broker submits wife application, husband interest discovered during verification
        
    - Current uncertainty about broker credit for spouse enrollments
        
    - Mark recommends broker should receive credit (client relationship originated through broker)
        
    - Potential for channel conflict if policy unclear
        
    - Sherry to discuss with Tony for definitive policy decision
        
- Manual enrollment status reporting urgent requirement:
    
    - Brokers promised access over 3 weeks ago

    - “What is going on with your company” complaints increasing
        
    - Must begin manual report generation immediately as interim solution
        
- Website improvements and training video integration:
    
    - Landing page enhancements completed by Jeannie (cleaner organization, functional anchors)
        
    - Broker kits should be positioned higher on page (currently require scrolling)
        
    - English/Spanish indicators could be compressed (ENG/ESP) for space efficiency
        
    - Training calendar needs supplementary prerecorded training videos link
        
    - Mark invited to sales/marketing calls to provide technical expertise

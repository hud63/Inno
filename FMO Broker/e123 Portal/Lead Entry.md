I agree the right process is for the broker or agent to submit the lead through e123. That’s exactly what I’ve asked our contact center to do moving forward. If they receive a call and the lead isn’t yet in the system, they should stay on the line while the broker or agent submits it, then follow the standard process as usual.

 

Copying @Glen Smith @Mark Cetola @David Gomez for visibility. Let’s get this into our FAQ document for the BSU (broker support unit). Thx!

The best process is to tell the Agent to add the lead the normal way.  Otherwise this will continue to happen and your Broker Support team will have a lot of data entry to do.   

 

What happens if the agent adds the lead via e123 - and if you already have it in your CRM- will it show duplicate?  We need to create a member ID that feeds back into your CRM.   We'll need to make sure that's affixed to your record.  

 

We can add this to our list of open items to train on and set some requirements to prevent a lot of rework.   I'm Miguel to this so he can add it to our list of open items - we can plan on how to cover leads that skip the process but best is to make sure Agents are directed to add their leads via the platform.    Or, we can train your intake team on how to do that, too?

Subject: Get InnSight Lead Back into e123

 

Hi Ron,

 

This is the separate issue that came up today from the contact center. Participant lead name is Gracie Benford. This record was created from an inbound call by Alexandra Crews. Broker was Lamonth Richardson who did NOT submit a lead via the e123 portal. We need to somehow get a record of this lead back into e123 manually to ensure commissions flow as expected. Can you connect with Angela to sort this out?

 

Lead: Gracie Benford at Orlando center

Broker: Lamont Richardson

FMO: Health Plan Markets

Of course. Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to follow based on the actions and dialogue in the video.

### **Part 1: Sending an Email Notification for Expiring Licenses**

This process sends a pre-made email template to a list of agents with licenses that are expiring soon.

1.  **Navigate to the Expired Licenses List:**
    *   From the main navigation bar, click on **Search**.
    *   From the dropdown menu that appears, under **Saved Lists**, click on **Expired License(s)**.
    *   This will display the **Expired License(s)** page, showing a list of agents whose licenses are due to expire.

2.  **Initiate a Bulk Email:**
    *   Above the list of agents on the right side of the screen, locate the row of action buttons (**Keep Search**, **Expired License(s) ▼**, **View List**, etc.).
    *   Click the **Email** button in this row.

3.  **Compose the Message Using a Template:**
    *   You are now on the **Send Message** page.
    *   Click the dropdown menu next to **Select a Template (optional)**.
    *   From the list, select the template named **Expiring License(s) 30 Day Notice**.
    *   Click the **DISPLAY** button to the right of the template dropdown.
    *   The page will reload, and fields such as **Mailing Label** and **SUBJECT** will be automatically populated with information from the template.

4.  **Review and Send the Email:**
    *   Scroll down to the **HTML Graphic Version** section to see a preview of the email that will be sent.
    *   Note that the placeholder text (e.g., `$licenseExpiresNext30`) will be automatically replaced with the specific expiring license information for each individual agent when the email is sent.
    *   Scroll to the bottom-left of the page.
    *   Click the **Send Email Only** button to send the notification to all 7 agents in the list.
    *   *(In the video, the user clicks **Cancel** instead of sending, which returns them to the Expired Licenses list.)*

### **Part 2: Reviewing an Individual Agent's Profile and Documents**

This process shows how to access an agent's detailed information and view their uploaded documents.

1.  **Select an Agent:**
    *   From any agent list, click on the hyperlinked number under the **Agent ID • Link •** column for the agent you wish to view. In the video, the user clicks on **898010** for **MCGIRL INSURANCE**.

2.  **View Agent Profile:**
    *   A new tab will open displaying the agent's full profile. This page includes their contact information, parent organization, status, and other details.

3.  **Download and Review Documents:**
    *   Scroll down to the **Documents** section at the bottom of the profile page.
    *   You will see a list of documents associated with the agent (e.g., W-9 Form, Signature, Insurance Form E&O Document).
    *   To view a document, click the **Download** icon in the far-right column for that document's row.
    *   The document (a PDF) will open in a new browser tab for you to review.
    *   Close the document tab to return to the agent's profile page. Repeat this for any other documents you need to check.

### **Part 3: Updating an Agent's Status**

This is how to change an agent's status, for example, after they have submitted all required documentation.

1.  **Navigate to the Update Section:**
    *   On the agent's profile page, locate the gray sub-navigation bar below the main header (which reads **MCGIRL INSURANCE - 898010**).
    *   Click on the **Update** link in this bar.

2.  **Change the Agent's Flag and Set Activation Date:**
    *   A new section will appear at the top of the page.
    *   Here you can change the agent's status using the **Flag** dropdown (e.g., from "Missing Documentation" to **Activated**).
    *   You can set the **Active** status to **Yes** or **No**.
    *   You can click into the **Agent Activation Date** field to select a specific date from the calendar.
    *   Once changes are made, click the **Save Information** button to confirm.

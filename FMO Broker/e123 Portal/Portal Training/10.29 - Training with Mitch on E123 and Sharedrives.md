    - Jolynn/Allan Insurance Services (Pueblo) - 250+ community meetings, radio shows, newspaper coverage
        
    - Advocate - Dawn managing, good performance
        
- Benefits Life/Scott Stafford - zero production, dealing with medical group disruption
    
- New Mexico struggling: only 10 agents total, disappointing performance from expected major producer

### Agent Portal Configuration

- Licensed field placement at page top improves visibility
    
    - Default position ensures agents see licenses first
        
    - Better than middle/bottom placement for user experience
        
- NPN field successfully added to agent list view
    
    - Located as “code one” in standard questions
        
    - Added next to agent ID with orange highlighting
        
    - Available in agent search columns for filtering
        

### Agent Impersonation Limitations

- Cannot impersonate agent front-end portal
    
- Alternative: Create test agent account for team training
    
    - Shows same interface layout as real agents
        
    - Missing only actual commission statements/documents
        
    - Broker support can reference real back-office data for comparison
        

### Commission Statement Setup

- CSV files automatically generated when commissions paid
    
- Both PDF and CSV formats provided simultaneously
    
    - PDFs preferred by agents for readability
        
    - CSVs preferred by FMOs for data processing
        
- No additional setup required from agents/FMOs
    

### User Guide Development

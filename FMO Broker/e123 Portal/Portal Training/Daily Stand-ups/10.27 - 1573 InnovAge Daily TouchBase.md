### System Issue Updates

- ZIP code issue resolved and tested successfully by Mark

    - Agent ID 924021 required approximately one-hour delay before reset triggered
        
    - Mark tested: edited agent in InnovAge back office, enabled “require new password on next login”
        
    - Logged out of both front end and back end in incognito tab
        
    - Initial login attempt did not trigger password reset prompt
        
    - Second attempt one hour later successfully triggered reset requirement
        
    - Similar issue occurred weeks ago with customer, prompting original line item creation
        
    - Shier assigned to investigate timing/system lag and attempt recreation
        
    - Root cause unclear - potential system or site timing issue

    - Ticket from Gino Kirkland submitted September 23rd
        
    - Issue: agent acknowledgment certification showing attachment error
        
    - No other agents reporting similar problems since submission
        
    - Unable to recreate issue - likely resolved given one-month timeframe
        
- Ron’s departure requires comprehensive ticket reassignment
    
    - Ron’s last day: previous Friday
        
    - All Ron-related development items transferred to Mark and Tony
        
    - Both users now have access to participate in relevant tickets
        
- Ticket 63675 assigned to Mark for immediate review
    
    - Related to pick list options and Cody’s integration requirements
        
    - Involves Medicare coverage question mapping challenges
        

### Form Logic Dependencies and Workarounds

- Medicare/Medicaid coverage questions causing form submission errors
    
    - Error message: “Answers required for question: where does your client get their Medicare coverage?”
        
    - Four total questions arranged in two logical pairs
        
- Original dependency request from onboarding phase
    
    - “Where do you get Medicare?” should only appear if user selects “yes” to having Medicare
        
    - “Where do you get Medicaid?” should only appear if user selects “yes” to having Medicaid
        
    - Initial development team confirmed “no problem” with implementation
        
- Current workaround implementation challenges
    
    - Dependent logic proving more complex than anticipated in UI
        
    - Shiger updated help text to include “only answer if client currently has Medicare, otherwise select not sure/don’t know”
        
    - Third option “don’t know” added for non-applicable scenarios
        
    - Cody still wants to capture information even when not directly applicable
        
- Resolution approach: document original request, accept workaround if development complexity too high
    
    - Not make-or-break functionality but ideal user experience desired
        
    - Stack rank priority adjustment if significant development required
        

### Testing Environment and Field Configuration

- Mark currently testing exclusively in production environment
    
    - Using daily InnovAge account login and dummy test account
        
    - No current access to UAT version of portal
        
- UAT access setup required for proper testing workflow
    
    - Miguel assigned to provide UAT login credentials to Mark
        
    - Needed before tomorrow’s training session
        
    - Future protocol: test in UAT environment before production deployment
        
- Dedicated UAT instance still under development
    
    - Follow-up required by tomorrow for status update
        
    - Will enable proper testing without affecting production records or reporting
        
    - Can connect to UAT CRM environment for complete API testing
        
- Phone field mapping clarification needed
    
    - Current labels: “Phone” and “Phone 2” require specific naming
        
    - CRM has designated “home phone” and “mobile phone” fields
        
    - Request: provide developer field names for phone 1 and phone 2 mapping
        
    - Solution: relabel fields rather than modify API integration
        
    - Mark to update field mapping information for proper CRM alignment
        

### Action Items and Next Steps

- Shier: investigate password reset timing delay for agent ID 924021
    
- Tony: follow up with Cody on API update status and schedule tomorrow’s testing call if ready
    
- Miguel: provide Mark with UAT portal access credentials before tomorrow’s training
    
- Mark: review ticket 63675 regarding pick list options and Medicare coverage dependencies
    
- Mark: provide developer field names for phone 1 and phone 2 mapping to enable proper labeling
    
- Tony: follow up on dedicated UAT instance progress by tomorrow
    
- Team: implement UAT-first testing protocol for all future updates before production deployment

# 10.20 - 1573 Daily Touchbase

Mon, 20 Oct 25

### Technical Issues Requiring Resolution

- Google Meet access anomaly
    
    - Mark can enter meetings without admission (bypasses waiting room)
        
    - Occurs with one other client contact as well
        
    - Likely due to Gmail account setup with Innovage email (has Drive/Docs but not Gmail)
        
- Password reset functionality
    
    - Users receive reset emails successfully
        
    - Password final screen displays blank after reset completion
        
    - Sometimes new passwords don’t take, forcing use of old password
        
    - Confusing user experience - should redirect to login or auto-login
        
- Application tile error persists
    
    - Broker portal still shows error for some users including Mark
        
    - Must remove “www” from URL to access
        
    - Issue tested multiple times today despite Friday 3PM Central fix
        
    - Pattern: fixes announced but problems persist upon testing
        

### API Integration Verification

- All applications showing as leads issue claimed resolved
    
    - Need verification through reconciliation tomorrow with Cody and Shire
        
    - Compare E123 application count vs received applications count
        
    - Account for test applications from Shire that may skew numbers
        
    - If broker-submitted apps appear on both sides, integration likely working
        

### Manual Lead Processing

- David Journey case requiring dual setup
    
    - Wife Diana submitted application through broker Laura Jones (Mother’s Care Insurance)
        
    - Husband David interested but no application submitted
        
    
    - Manual lead created in CRM for David Journey
        
    - Need to create corresponding E123 record using broker’s unique URL
        
    - Add referral contact info (Laura Jones, Mother’s Care Insurance) to both records
        
    - Amber (inside sales) unable to add broker referral during lead conversion
        

### Training Schedule & Resource Concerns

- Training sessions scheduled
    
    - Tomorrow 3PM Central (4PM Eastern) - Mark and David Gomez
        
    - Thursday 1PM Central (2PM Eastern) - Mark and David Gomez
        
    
    - Angela and Laura required as trainers
        
- Implementation frustrations raised
    
    - $50,000 implementation fee paid months ago
        
    - Still not at steady state operation
        
    - Only 2 FTEs in similar roles to Shire, both stretched thin during AEP
        
    - Request for acceleration options: temp hire, former employees, additional resources
        

### Next Steps

- Tony: Forward application tile error details to development team for Shire/Troy review
    
- Tony: Discuss resource allocation and acceleration options with Joe
    
- Mark: Transpose David Journey information manually into E123 using broker URL
    
- Team: Verify API integration during tomorrow’s call with reconciliation exercise
    
- Tony: Send training invites for scheduled sessions with Angela and Laura

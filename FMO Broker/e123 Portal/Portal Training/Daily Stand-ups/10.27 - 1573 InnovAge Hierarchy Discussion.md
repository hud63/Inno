## Detailed Summary: Final Meeting Conclusions

### **Core Hierarchy Architecture**

The meeting solidified a **three-tier system** (FMO → Agency → Agent) with unlimited agency nesting capability. The critical breakthrough was recognizing that **agencies are functionally identical to agents** from InnovAge’s payment and contracting perspective—they just have additional recruitment permissions. This means:

- All agencies go through the exact same certification, contract signing, and NPN registration as individual agents
- All agencies receive the same street-level commission rates when writing business
- The only contract fork is LOA vs. non-LOA (agencies cannot create LOAs, only FMOs can)
- Legal has already reviewed and approved this structure with no contract modifications needed

### **Commission Payment Structure (Simplified)**

InnovAge pays **exactly two entities** regardless of how deep the hierarchy tree goes:

1. **Street-level commission** → Writing agent/agency (whoever’s NPN is on the enrollment)
2. **Override commission** → Top-level FMO only

All middle-layer agencies handle their own internal commission splits through private agreements that InnovAge is not privy to. This dramatically simplifies payment logic—even if there are 5 agency layers, InnovAge only cuts two checks.

**Exception flagged:** Mother’s Care appears to be writing business directly under their FMO NPN while also receiving FMO overrides. Sherry needs to investigate whether they have dual contract entries or if contract language needs clarification.

### **Data Requirements for Dynamics CRM**

For every enrollment, InnovAge’s CRM needs three data points:

1. **Agent of record** (the writing entity’s NPN)
2. **Direct parent agency** (one click up from the agent)
3. **Top-level FMO** (tree traversal to find root)

The middle-layer parent agency may create new contact records in Dynamics that didn’t exist before. This data enables Mark’s sales team to identify productive vs. unproductive agencies within an FMO’s network and target in-services accordingly.

### **User Experience & Technical Solution**

The team converged on **eliminating the landing page for FMOs** entirely (they go straight to sign-up) while **creating a simplified hub for agencies** with three critical functions:

**What agencies need in one place:**

1. **Agent Portal link** - Access tiles for writing business (participant application, reporting, etc.)
2. **Back Office link** - FMO-style view to manage their downline hierarchy
3. **Password-free recruitment links** - Copy/paste URLs to distribute to downline recruits

**Current problem:** These links are scattered across 20+ URLs on the page, buried in footers, or only accessible via one-time welcome emails that get lost in inboxes.

**Design mandate:** Strip away InnovAge logos, product blocks, and footer clutter. Get the three CTAs above the fold with prominent pill-shaped buttons matching the current teal/orange design language.

### **Password Elimination Strategy**

The meeting reached consensus that **password requirements must be completely removed** because:

- Contracts require e-signatures—uplines can’t complete sign-ups on behalf of recruits anyway
- Current process requires emailing links AND separately communicating passwords (double friction)
- Industry standard is accessible URLs without authentication barriers
- FMOs specifically requested URLs be visible in their back office, not buried in welcome emails

**Technical debate unresolved:** Should sign-up links live on the Agent Portal (already has 2 of 3 required links but uses different template) or on the enhanced landing page (more dynamic but currently only has sign-up)? The Agent Portal route is complicated by URL structure differences (no 6-digit ID in portal URLs vs. landing page URLs).

Troy and Shayah need to meet Tuesday/Wednesday to determine feasibility of adding sign-up functionality to the Agent Portal while restricting visibility (agents shouldn’t see recruitment links, only agencies).

### **Training & Sandbox Requirements**

FMOs requested an **interactive sandbox environment** (not just PDF documentation) where they can:

- Walk their agents through the participant application process
- Demonstrate the enrollment workflow in real-time during training calls
- Access this via a static URL that doesn’t require individual logins

**Implementation:** Create a demo agent whose submissions never reach Dynamics production. This same universal link can be shared with all FMOs. The current test agent accidentally drops leads into production and needs modification (dev ticket required).

### **Welcome Email Simplification**

Current approach uses role-specific emails with different links for FMOs, agencies, and agents. The team wants to **standardize to one universal template**:

> “Here’s your website: [URL]. Click here to view it.”

All role-specific functionality (which buttons/links appear) would be controlled by backend permissions rather than different email templates. This reduces maintenance overhead and confusion.

### **Open Questions & Next Steps**

**Immediate (Tuesday):**

- Troy + Shayah meeting to assess Agent Portal feasibility for housing recruitment links
- Determine if static link buttons can be added to portal without breaking dynamic functionality

**Short-term (by Wednesday):**

- Provide ETA on final deliverable to Mark and Tony
- Create dev ticket for test agent production lead prevention
- Sherry reviews Mother’s Care dual-role contracting situation offline

**Pending technical decisions:**

- Drop-down selection for agent type (if password elimination can’t be achieved immediately)
- Whether to adapt existing 1016 template or create Agent Portal tiles
- How to handle URL structure differences between portal and landing page

The meeting ended with clarity on **business logic** (commissions, hierarchy rules, data requirements) but unresolved **technical implementation** questions that require backend architecture discussion before finalizing the user-facing solution.

### InnovAge Hierarchy Structure & Goals

- Three-tier system: FMO → Agency → Agent/LOA
    
    - FMOs can sign up agencies and LOAs underneath them
        
    - Agencies can sign up sub-agencies and individual agents
        
    - Agencies cannot create LOAs (FMO-only capability)
        
- Clean tree structure required for FMO reporting and commission distribution
    
    - FMOs need to export hierarchy trees to their systems
        
    - Called “tree” in e123 system terminology
        
- Data layers sent to Dynamics CRM:
    
    - Agent of record (writing agent/agency)
        
    - Direct parent agency (may be new contact in Dynamics)
        
    - Top-level FMO
        
- Agencies can write business directly as contracted agents
    
    - Same NPN, W-9, certification process as individual agents
        
    - Currently happening in production with existing agencies
        

### Landing Page Architecture & User Experience

- Current UAT environment shows front-end landing page design
    
- User flow distinctions by role:
    
    - FMOs: Direct to sign-up page (no landing page needed)
        
    - Agencies: Need both enrollment and downline recruitment capabilities
        
    - Agents: No sign-up links (recruitment not allowed)
        
- Three critical CTAs needed for agencies:
    
    - Agent Portal: tiles for writing business, existing functionality
        
    - Back Office: FMO-style view for managing downline hierarchy
        
    - Sign Up: password-free recruitment links
        
- Current page has ~20 URLs but only 3 matter for core functionality
    
- Design simplification requirements:
    
    - Remove InnovAge logo and product blocks
        
    - Eliminate footer clutter
        
    - Position three primary CTAs above the fold
        
    - Make buttons prominent like current teal/orange pill-shaped designs
        

### Password Elimination & Link Distribution

- Major operational pain point identified:
    
    - FMOs currently only have recruitment links buried in welcome emails
        
    - Contracting teams can’t easily access links for distribution
        
    - Industry standard: carriers provide accessible URLs in back office
        
- Technical challenge: Static vs dynamic links
    
    - Static links (Agent Portal, Back Office) can use HTML pill buttons
        
    - Dynamic links (Sign Up) contain unique 6-digit IDs in URL
        
    - Sign-up links change per entity, can’t be pre-configured
        
- Goal: Eliminate password requirements entirely for all sign-ups
    
    - Contracts require signatures, can’t be completed by uplines anyway
        
    - Password page becomes unnecessary friction point
        
- Drop-down selection concept discussed as interim solution
    
    - Allow selection of agent vs agency type
        
    - Still requires password elimination in final implementation
        

### Agent Portal vs Landing Page Implementation

- Technical debate between two approaches:
    
    - Agent Portal route: Add sign-up functionality to existing portal
        
        - Already has Back Office and Participant Application links
            
        - Missing only password-free sign-up capability
            
        - Challenge: Portal uses different template, less dynamic
            
        - Difficulty showing sign-up links only for agencies (not agents)
            
    - Landing Page route: Enhance current 1016 template
        
        - More dynamic, configurable per entity
            
        - Can enable/disable features per user type
            
        - Currently has sign-up but missing other required links
            
- Agent Portal URL structure doesn’t contain 6-digit ID (unlike landing page)
    
- Need solution that works universally without requiring multiple features
    

### Sandbox & Training Requirements

- FMOs requested interactive training capability
    
- Two options discussed:
    
    - Static PDF documentation showing process
        
    - Interactive sandbox with demo agent
        
- Decision: Interactive sandbox preferred
    
- Implementation requirements:
    
    - Create demo agent that doesn’t send leads to Dynamics
        
    - Same URL can be shared with all FMOs for training
        
    - Current test agent in production needs modification
        
- UAT environment not suitable (ongoing development activities)
    

### Commission Structure & Contracts

- InnovAge pays only two levels regardless of hierarchy depth:
    
    - Street-level commission to writing agent/agency
        
    - Override commission to top-level FMO only
        
- Middle-layer agencies receive no InnovAge override payments
    
    - Handle internal commission splits via private agreements
        
- Contract consistency:
    
    - Same agent agreement applies to agencies
        
    - Same commission rates regardless of agent vs agency designation
        
    - Legal review completed - no contract modifications needed
        
    - LOA vs non-LOA remains only fork in contracting process
        
- Mother’s Care exception requiring investigation:
    
    - FMO writing business directly under their NPN
        
    - Currently receiving both agent commission and FMO override
        
    - May need separate contract entries (FMO role + writing agent role)
        
    - Contract language review needed to clarify payment structure
        

### Welcome Email & Communication Simplification

- Goal: Standardize welcome emails across all entity types
    
- Current approach: Role-specific emails with different links
    
- Proposed: Universal email with single website link
    
    - “Here’s your website” approach
        
    - Reduces email template management overhead
        
    - Entity-specific functionality controlled by backend permissions
        

### Technical Constraints & Open Questions

- Template limitations:
    
    - Agent website (1016) more dynamic but missing some links
        
    - Agent portal less dynamic but has most required functionality
        
- Multiple products consideration: InnovAge confirmed single product only
    
- Password drop-down complexity increases with additional entity types
    
- Backend development required either way for link accessibility
    

### Next Steps

- Troy and Shayah: Immediate discussion on agent portal feasibility
    
    - Assess difficulty of adding sign-up links to portal
        
    - Determine static vs dynamic link technical constraints
        
- Sherry: Review Mother’s Care contracting situation offline
    
    - Examine NPN entries and contract language
        
    - Clarify payment structure requirements
        
- Development tasks:
    
    - Create ticket for test agent production lead prevention
        
    - Sandbox environment setup for FMO training
        
- Timeline deliverables:
    
    - Tomorrow: Initial feasibility assessment (Troy/Shayah meeting)
        
    - Wednesday: Final ETA on complete deliverable
        
    - Ongoing: Password elimination solution design

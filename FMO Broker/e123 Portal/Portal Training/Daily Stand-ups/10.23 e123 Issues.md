### Agent Portal Access & Documentation Issues

**Problem:** Core agent management functionality broken

- Cannot add notes to agent records despite training configuration
    
    - Tony and Mark specifically enabled notes field during E123 training session
        
    - Notes mysteriously removed from agent interface
        
    - Still functional in participant records but agents are primary interface
        
- Agent record access intermittently failing
    
    - Plymouth Meeting PA agent example - couldn’t access record details
        
    - Consistent across multiple agent profiles tested
        

**Impact:**

- Unable to document agent follow-up communications
    
- Recognition emails to writing agents cannot be tracked
    
- Manual workarounds consuming significant time
    
- Team frustration (Steven, Sean, all broker support staff)
    

**Evidence:**

- Mark demonstrated live inability to access Irene’s agent record
    
- Notes field visibly missing from agent interface during screen share
    
- Participant records retain note functionality, confirming selective removal
    

**Next Steps:**

- Mark: Document specific examples for E123 training call
    
- E123: Restore notes functionality to agent records (no ETA provided)
    
- Mark: Test and confirm resolution post-fix
    

### FMO Export Capabilities Failure

**Problem:** Critical export functionality non-operational for FMOs

- Advocate (national FMO): All export settings enabled but exports still failing
    
- Mark impersonated Advocate account - confirmed exports not displaying
    
- Jolyn Allen (Allen Insurance Services, Colorado): Previously praised export features during onboarding call
    

**Impact:**

- FMOs cannot process commission payments to agents
    
- System feeds to FMO internal platforms broken
    
- Business relationship risk with sophisticated national partners
    
- Agents may not write business without commission processing guarantees
    

**Evidence:**

- Live demonstration of failed export attempt during meeting
    
- Mark verified all user settings enabled for Advocate
    
- Jolyn’s positive feedback on export capabilities now meaningless without functionality
    

**Next Steps:**

- Mark: Escalate Advocate export issue in training session (today)
    
- E123: Identify and resolve export permission/functionality bugs (no ETA)
    
- Mark: Test with multiple FMO accounts post-resolution
    

### Data Quality & Mandatory Field Issues

**Problem:** Non-mandatory state field causing data integrity issues

- Agents not required to enter state during contracting setup
    
- Manual correction required for every new agent
    
- Plymouth Meeting 19 example - unclear if Virginia or Pennsylvania
    
- Impacts FMO system integrations and reporting accuracy
    

**Impact:**

- Significant manual overhead for broker support team
    
- Data quality issues affecting downstream processes
    
- Team frustration across all support staff
    

**Evidence:**

- Mark demonstrated live correction of Pennsylvania agent record
    
- Multiple examples cited of missing state information
    
- Steven and Sean specifically complained about this issue
    

**Next Steps:**

- E123: Make state field mandatory in contracting workflow (promised during initial E123 training, no current ETA)
    
- Mark: Include in priority discussion list for vendor
    

### Agent ID vs NPN Field Issue

**Problem:** Agent ID field displayed instead of NPN (National Producer Number)

- Identified on Mark’s first day (3+ weeks ago)
    
- FMOs and agents complaining about incorrect field
    
- Critical for FMO system feeds and commission processing
    

**Impact:**

- FMO system integration failures
    
- Agent and FMO complaints increasing
    
- Professional credibility concerns
    

**Evidence:**

- Issue documented since day one of platform usage
    
- Multiple FMO complaints received
    
- Standard industry practice requires NPN display
    

**Next Steps:**

- Mark: Raise priority level in vendor discussions
    
- E123: Replace Agent ID field with NPN field (no ETA despite 3+ week timeline)
    

### Communication Features & Template Management

**Problem:** Limited email communication capabilities

- Cannot upload custom email templates (only view existing)
    
- Need HTML capability for professional marketing materials
    
- 52 Florida agents need Halloween event invitations
    
- Current templates insufficient for ongoing needs
    

**Current Workarounds:**

- Mark can use existing templates with modified content
    
- Manual HTML paste possible but untested
    
- Sender can be customized (Steven for Florida, Mitch Hale for Colorado, Sean Bulls for California)
    

**Evidence:**

- Steven’s Halloween event flyer (Tampa and Orlando versions) ready for distribution
    
- Template modification interface demonstrated but upload restrictions confirmed
    

**Next Steps:**

- Jeannie: Provide HTML version of Halloween flyer for testing
    
- Mark: Test HTML template upload capability
    
- Mark: Demonstrate email features to team Friday
    
- E123: Enable template upload privileges for broker support
    

### Platform Performance & User Experience

**Problem:** Poor platform performance and user flow design

- Agent lookup taking excessive time to load
    
- Impersonation feature requires full logout/login cycle
    
- No front-end impersonation capability
    
- Comparison to UnitedHealthcare portal shows significant gaps
    

**Impact:**

- Daily workflow inefficiencies
    
- Poor user experience affecting team productivity
    
- Questions about vendor capability vs. promises
    

**Evidence:**

- Live demonstration of slow load times during meeting
    
- Impersonation flow testing showed logout requirement
    
- UnitedHealthcare portal comparison based on Mark’s experience
    

### Support Response & Vendor Relationship

**Problem:** Inadequate vendor support response times

- HERA ticket system not responsive
    
- Laura (E123 training contact) not answering direct emails
    
- Angela suggested direct email over HERA - both methods failing
    
- Emergency bug fixes consuming all developer resources
    

**Impact:**

- Critical issues remain unresolved for weeks
    
- Business operations affected by broken functionality
    
- Team cannot perform basic job functions
    

**Evidence:**

- Multiple unanswered tickets and emails cited
    
- Vendor acknowledgment of emergency fixes taking priority
    
- 3+ week timeline on basic field changes
    

### Commission Reporting Gap

**Problem:** No commission reporting functionality for FMOs

- Essential for FMO operations and agent payments
    
- 3 qualified applications pending state approval
    
- December payouts approaching with no reporting capability
    
- Tony considering internal development as alternative
    

**Impact:**

- FMOs cannot pay agent overrides
    
- Business operations failure risk
    
- Contract obligations may be unmet
    

**Evidence:**

- Live demonstration showing absence of commission reporting tab
    
- Applications pipeline confirmed (1-3 qualified, pending state approval)
    
- December payment timeline approaching
    

**Next Steps:**

- Mark: Discuss commission reporting priority with Tony
    
- Tony: Determine internal development timeline
    
- E123: Provide ETA for commission reporting module
    

### Enrollment Status Reporting Issues

**Problem:** Automated enrollment status feeds not functional

- Manual report generation required twice weekly
    
- Cody working with E123 on feed integration
    
- No ETA for automated resolution
    

**Impact:**

- Manual overhead consuming team resources
    
- Inconsistent reporting timing
    
- Scalability concerns as business grows
    

**Next Steps:**

- Mark: Get update from Cody on E123 integration progress
    
- E123: Complete enrollment status feed automation
    

### Training & Communication Coordination

**Problem:** Training scheduling and communication workflow needs improvement

- November training submissions due Friday (Oct 25)
    
- Webinar registration vs. recurring Teams meetings debate
    
- Monthly FMO portal training delayed pending feature completion
    

**Current Process:**

- Teams recurring meetings preferred over individual webinar links
    
- Registration tracking less important than consistent links
    
- Monthly training template updates required
    

**Next Steps:**

- Mark: Add November tab to training spreadsheet
    
- Steven/Sean: Submit November training schedules by Friday
    
- Mark: Coordinate with Jeannie on training communications
    
- Team: Decide on webinar vs. Teams approach Friday
    

### Risks & Dependencies

**High Risk:**

- 3-year contract with punitive early exit clauses
    
- FMO relationships at risk due to export/commission failures
    
- Agent acquisition may slow without functional portal features
    

**Critical Dependencies:**

- E123 developer resources focused on emergency fixes
    
- Tony’s availability for internal development discussions
    
- State approval timeline for pending applications affecting commission reporting urgency
    

**Vendor Relationship:**

- Support response inadequate for business-critical issues
    
- No ETAs provided for essential functionality
    
- Emergency fixes consuming all development resources

### Hierarchy Changes - Phase 1

- Tony leads hierarchy change update, pending approval with ~1 week timeline
    
- Mark and Mark Newagemedia tested earlier but encountered confusion
    
    - Need live walkthrough session for final clarity
        
    - Testing in UAT doesn’t reflect planned sign-up link functionality
        
- Core confusion: Agency capability layers and relationship to FMO structure
    
    - How many hierarchy levels to support
        
    - Which entities can sign up which other entities
        

### Agency Structure Requirements and Capabilities

- FMO capabilities confirmed:
    
    - Sign up agencies (new requirement)
        
    - Sign up agents (existing)
        
    - Access application links (added per FMO request from earlier call)
        
- Agency capabilities confirmed:
    
    - Sign up agents (required)
        
    - Access applications (required)
        
    - Sign up sub-agencies (open question - marked as “no” initially but needs validation)
        
- Agent capabilities (baseline):
    
    - Access applications only
        
    - Cannot sign up other entities
        

### Contract Framework and Hierarchy Model

- Only two contract types exist: Agent contract and FMO contract
    
- Key principle: Agencies contract as agents, not separate agency contracts
    
- Hierarchy structure: FMO → Agency → Sub-agency → Agent
    
    - All participants ultimately contract with FMO
        
    - Chain of custody maintained through link encoding
        
    - Tree structure visible to FMO for payment reconciliation
        
- FMO payment responsibility:
    
    - Sees full tree structure for override payment calculations
        
    - Internal sub-agency override agreements handled separately
        
    - Platform provides reporting data, not payment processing
        

### Technical Implementation and Link Encoding

- Same agent link used for both agency and agent sign-ups
    
- Critical requirement: Agency links must embed FMO code for proper tree alignment
    
    - When agency sends sub-agency link, must include both FMO and parent agency codes
        
    - Ensures proper hierarchy tracking in reporting
        
- Shayir needs to discuss relationship structure with Troy
    
    - Open question: How to handle agency-to-agency sign-up metadata
        
    - Dependency: Troy consultation before Monday session
        
- Most core functionality already exists, primary gap is agency sign-up capability
    

### Testing and Timeline Coordination

- Live drafting session scheduled for Monday 3PM Pacific
    
    - Confirmed participants: Tony, Mark Newagemedia, Angela, Sherry
        
    - Purpose: Finalize documentation and get production sign-off
        
    - Dependency: Shayir’s consultation with Troy
        
- Backup options if Troy meeting delays Monday session:
    
    - Tuesday 6AM Pacific
        
    - Tuesday 9AM Pacific
        
    - Tuesday 10AM Pacific
        
- Goal: Avoid “hierarchy carousel” - get final decisions locked in
    

### User Test Findings - Phase 2

- Additional resource (David) brought in to accelerate resolution
    
- David has significant experience, minimal onboarding required
    
- Meeting scheduled 20 minutes after this call to review open items
    
- Expected to close outstanding user test findings quickly
    

### API Updates and Field Additions

- Cody providing workflow updates by Monday morning
    
    - Activity workflow inside CRM nearly complete
        
    - Just needs final testing before sending
        
- New requirement: NPN fields for all three hierarchy levels
    
    - Agency NPN
        
    - Agent NPN
        
    - FMO NPN
        
- Technical details:
    
    - Single status field mapping (past status removed due to complications)
        
    - Quick turnaround once Cody delivers - just field population on status changes
        
    - No impact on existing API structure
        

### ZIP Code Validation Critical Issues

- Specific failures identified:
    
    - ZIP 80016 (Colorado, outside Denver) - non-covered area allowed through
        
    - West Sacramento (Yolo County) - out of catchment ZIP processed
        
- Current behavior: Some blocked ZIPs work correctly, others fail validation
    
- Root cause analysis needed:
    
    - Verify original ZIP list from Tony/Ron loaded correctly
        
    - White list approach confirmed (approved ZIPs only)
        
    - Relatively static list - changes rare, require formal approval process
        
- Severity guidance: Mark as Severity 3 for production impact
    
    - Sev 1-2 reserved for platform-wide outages
        
    - Sev 3 appropriate for individual feature affecting production
        
- Immediate actions:
    
    - Shayir to reupload approved ZIP list
        
    - Validate list completeness against Tony’s original
        
    - Priority fix due to broker relationship impact
        

### Commission Structure and 13-Month Rule

- Critical clarification on 13-month eligibility:
    
    - Must be enrolled on December 1st (not November 30th) for renewal
        
    - Example: December 1, 2026 enrollment = 13th month reached
        
    - Sherry’s interpretation of November 30th was incorrect
        
- Tony to provide formal written sign-off on commission presentation
    
    - Angela made requested changes to documentation
        
    - Need paper trail for final approval
        
- Separate detailed session required for commission reporting:
    
    - Sherry identified non-standard fields in reporting vs UHC format
        
    - PDF statements ready, Excel version pending field setup
        
    - Fields may be named differently but serve same purpose
        

### Training Progress and Schedule

- Current status: 6-7 training sessions completed
    
- Mark performing excellently, David also progressing well
    
- Two additional sessions scheduled for next week:
    
    - Tuesday 2PM Central (3PM Eastern)
        
    - Thursday 3PM Central (4PM Eastern)
        
- Future support structure:
    
    - Ongoing monthly TPA team calls to be established
        
    - Direct email access for questions
        
    - Laura (trainer) for initial sessions, TPA team for ongoing support
        

### Account Funding Verification

- Original deadline: October 24th (today) - likely missed
    
- Verification scheduled for Monday with Angela’s assistance
    
- Tony’s accountability: Made commitment knowing accounts payable consistency issues
    
- Contingency: If missed, set new deadline (October 28th) with firmer commitment
    
- Angela to help ensure accounts payable follows through
    

### Next Steps and Dependencies

- Shayir: Consult with Troy on agency relationship structure before Monday
    
- Tony: Provide written commission presentation sign-off
    
- Development team: ZIP code validation priority fix (Severity 3)
    
- Cody: Deliver API updates and NPN field specifications by Monday morning
    
- All stakeholders: Attend Monday 3PM Pacific hierarchy documentation session
    
- Follow-up: Schedule separate commission reporting deep-dive session

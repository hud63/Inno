### Technical Issues & Meeting Access

- Recurring problem with joining meetings
    
    - Sometimes can get in, sometimes can’t
        
    - Issue affects multiple clients
        
    - Colleagues mock late arrivals (“thanks for joining our meeting”)
        
- Tony delayed due to back-to-back vendor calls
    

### Training Progress & Schedule

- Today’s session covered email functionality
    
    - Focus on intricate back-end features
        
    - Advanced tools for future use cases
        
- Remaining schedule:
    
    - One more session Thursday
        
    - Laura to determine if additional training needed
        
    - Friday call with Shire (Miguel out)
        

### User Configuration Updates

- Agent user type correction completed
    
    - Users mistakenly set as “agent” instead of “FMO”
        
    - Mark fixed after email notification
        
    - Common early implementation mistake
        

### License Expiration Process Implementation

- From original UAT findings, not new email request
    
- Pending requirements from Tony:
    
    - Email verbiage for agent notifications
        
    - Upload workflow confirmation (BSU vs agent responsibility)
        
- Mark’s approach:
    
    - BSU will handle uploads (not agents directly)
        
    - Will repurpose existing expiration email template
        
    - 30-day advance notice format
        

### Florida License Configuration

- Hide expiration date field for Florida only
    
    - Florida licenses don’t expire
        
    - Prevents mistaken data entry
        
- State field now required during agent/FMO signup
    
    - Will be added to new agency signup process
        

### System Updates & Bug Fixes

- Participant application bug - Tony responded today
    
- Commission document revisions:
    
    - Angela made requested updates
        
    - Sending to Tony for final approval within hour
        
- Forgot username feature:
    
    - CNB approved implementation
        
    - Awaiting scope and timeline
        
    - No dev hours charged (system-wide upgrade)
        
    - Code freeze until mid-December (post-ADP enrollment)
        

### UAT Progress & Communication

- Mark updating Smartsheet with test results
    
- New process for completed items:
    
    - Keep green status if no further action needed
        
    - Use ETA field with different color for visibility
        
    - Enables quick scanning for Miguel’s review
        

### Agency Link Placement Discussion

- Shire unable to share screen yesterday evening
    
- Clear preferences communicated to Troy and Shire
    
- Waiting on technical feasibility assessment
    
- Links would go in configurable info section (upper right)
    
- Final placement depends on available options
    

### Next Steps

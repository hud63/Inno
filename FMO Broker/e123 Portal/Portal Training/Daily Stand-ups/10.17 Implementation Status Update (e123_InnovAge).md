### Hierarchy Change Status

- Meeting rescheduled to Monday 3:00pm to discuss requirements
    
    - Will extend daily 3pm meeting by 30 minutes
        
    - Won’t delay next week’s sprint - changes are small updates
        
    - Troy already built agent sign-up, knows how to implement updates
        
- Emily needs capacity placeholder for potential Monday deliverables
    
- Requirements document being updated with Tony’s email input before Monday

    - Must reach AP by end-of-day Tuesday

### Critical System Issues Blocking Enrollments

- Password reset bug: Users get blank screen after confirmation
    
    - Fix ready, awaiting deployment today
        
    - Shire working with Austin for emergency push
        
- WWW redirect issue: Also being deployed in same emergency release
    
- Username recovery: No “forgot username” functionality
    
    - Presented to change management board this week
        
    - Awaiting decision - affects all clients, not just InnovAge
        
    - Likely architectural reason it doesn’t exist
        

### Enrollment Status Updates (Phase 2)

- 13 enrollments submitted, none showing status updates
    
- Cody out sick - primary developer on API integration
    
- Scheduled Monday meeting with Cody for status testing
    
- Causing significant broker friction:
    
    - Brokers test with 1-2 applications first
        
    - No visibility = pause in writing business
        
    - Over week delay, not even showing “received” status
        
- Need backup developer if Cody remains unavailable
    

### Missing Verification Phone Number

- Confirmation page supposed to display verification phone number post-submission
    
- Was part of original implementation plan with Ron
    
- Currently causing enrollment delays - agents don’t know to call
    
- Phone number: [provided in chat]
    
- Quick fix needed - affects field sales process
    

### Application Volume Impact

- Expected couple hundred applications during AEP
    
- Currently at only 13 applications due to system issues
    
- Contributing factors:
    
    - Late launch missed key FMO contracting window
        
    - Target was August 15 for agent certification/contracting
        
    - Currently ~220 contracted agents vs 500 minimum expected
        
    - Lost major writers due to login/submission problems
        

### Communication & Process Improvements

- Need urgent priority marking for enrollment-blocking issues
    
- Daily updates between Tony and Miguel
    
- Adding team to Jira tickets for automatic notifications
    
- [Implementation@enrollment123.com](mailto:Implementation@enrollment123.com) for forwarding issues
    
- Shire setting up Jira access for ticket tracking
    

### Next Steps

- Monday 3:00pm: Hierarchy requirements discussion (extended meeting)
    
- Emergency deployment today: Password reset + WWW fixes
    
- Follow up with Tony on Cody backup developer
    
- Send verification phone number message to development team
    
- Bank account information to be submitted within 15 minutes

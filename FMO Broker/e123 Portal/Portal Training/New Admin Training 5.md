### Agent Activation Process

- Mark previously activated agents incorrectly by only hitting “Active” button without setting proper activation flag
    
- Correct two-step activation process required:
    
    - Active flag: Located in tracking section under agent profile
        
    - Active date: Found in setup column on left-hand side under Agent ID and Parent fields
        
    - Both dates must be entered for complete activation
        
- Active flag specifically triggers welcome email automation to newly activated agents
    
- Left-hand side “Active” toggle controls agent’s actual login ability to their agent portal
    
- Only activate agents after receiving all required documents:
    
    - E&O insurance documentation
        
    - State licensing verification
        
    - Other compliance materials as needed
        
- If activation done without flag initially, can return later to complete process by adding flag and date
    

### Document Review Responsibilities

- Laura’s team contracted to handle twice-daily document verification at 9am and 2pm
    
- Statement of work specifies this as paid service to ensure data accuracy before commission payments
    
- Mark should transition from document checking to follow-up activities:
    
    - Agent communication and support
        
    - Missing document follow-up
        
    - Status updates and relationship management
        
- Exception: If Mark obtains missing documents directly from agents, he can activate immediately
    
    - Shows documented request for missing materials
        
    - Demonstrates partnership between Mark and backend team
        
    - Maintains audit trail for activation decisions
        
- Team verifies documents are “true and correct” or at least “presented as true and correct” by agents
    

### Username Reset and Management

- Username changes accessible through agent profile “Edit User” function
    
- Navigation: Agent profile > Edit button > Left sidebar shows username field
    
- Best practice recommendation: Change forgotten usernames to agent’s email address
    
    - Prevents future username memory issues
        
    - Standardizes login process
        
- System limitation: Prevents duplicate email addresses across platform
    
    - If agent sells for multiple organizations using platform, email won’t work
        
    - System will block duplicate attempt and require alternative username
        
- Documentation requirements for all username changes:
    
    - Copy original email request into agent notes or interactions section
        
    - Provides proof agent requested change
        
    - Protects against future disputes (“I never asked for this change”)
        
    - Creates audit trail with date and requester information
        

### Note Visibility and Administrative Controls

- Two types of notes based on admin checkbox selection:
    
    - Admin-flagged notes: Only visible to broker support (internal team)
        
    - Regular notes: Visible to appropriate user types based on security settings
        
- Admin visibility controlled by “View Admin Info” permission in user security types
    
- Current visibility settings:
    
    - Broker Support: Can see admin notes (internal team)
        
    - FMO users: Cannot view admin-flagged content
        
    - Agent users: Cannot view admin-flagged content
        
- Best practice: Check admin box when leaving internal notes about system changes, troubleshooting, or sensitive information
    

### Commission Assignment and Manual Adjustments

- Anticipated issue: Agents not receiving proper commission credit due to CRM integration problems
    
- Example scenario discussed:
    
    - Wife entered by broker through normal process
        
    - During verification call, mentions husband also needs coverage
        
    - Manual entry required in CRM, then manual entry in E123 system
        
    - Used broker’s URL to ensure proper attribution
        
- Manual commission changes require strict oversight:
    
    - TPA (Third Party Administrator) held accountable for all payments
        
    - Cannot make changes without full documentation in platform
        
    - Must communicate with team before making adjustments
        
- Future training planned when specific cases arise
    
- Business process improvements needed on client side to prevent issues:
    
    - Proper lead creation procedures
        
    - Better CRM to E123 integration
        
    - Clear workflows for edge cases

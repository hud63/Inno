shes a precontracted FMO. They did the FMO contract link with Integrity language as an integrity partner. Is their FMO agreement supposed to be stored in their back office under documents? When I looked this was all I could find. I thought based on our prior conversations with e123 the whole contract would live there. Let me know, thanks!Â oh, one more thing. They did the FMO override agreement which is why they're precontracted and is stored in Lextree.


  **Outstanding Questions**:
  4. Should complete FMO agreement be stored in back office under documents?
  5. What is the standard storage protocol for FMO vs. individual agent contracts?
  6. How should Lextree and back office document storage be coordinated?
  7. Is there a gap between expected and actual document storage processes?

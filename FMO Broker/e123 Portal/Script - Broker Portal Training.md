### **Part 1: Meeting Introduction & General Discussion**

**(Start of Training Script)**

"Welcome, everyone.

Before we dive in, does anybody have any pressing questions?

Comments or questions about anything at all?

(Pause for responses)

Okay, let's talk about the PACE program. Has everybody ordered their sales kits yet?

If not, that's okay. We'll be walking through how to do that today.

It's a super simple process.

The kits come in packs of five. And unlike some of the bulky carrier kits you might be used to—the ones that are a half-inch thick—ours are much more consolidated.

We've streamlined everything to make it really nice and easy to carry.

Now, there's one thing our kits don't have, and that's a paper application. That's because all our enrollments are done online through your broker portal, which we'll be looking at shortly.

But what's great about the kit is that when a client asks, 'How do I enroll?'... the material directs them to 'Contact your agent.'

This is a fantastic feature. It ensures that the business comes right back to you.

The kit itself is really a consolidated presentation. It has everything you need to explain PACE and InnovAge in a small, professional booklet."

### **Part 2: Broker Portal Training (Screen Share)**

"Alright, without further ado, let me go ahead and share my screen.

Can someone let me know when you can see it?"

**(Share your screen, displaying the InnovAge Broker Portal homepage.)**

**URL:** `https://broker.innovage.com/information/7000.cfm?page=home`

"Great.

So, when you first get your welcome letter, it will have your login information for this portal.

Here’s what I always recommend:

When you log in for the first time, save the site to your favorites. You can see how I have my 'star' icon selected here. This just makes it easy to come back to.

The URL is simple: **broker.innovage.com**.

Now, let's take a look at the layout. We designed this to be as simple as possible.

When you first log in, this is the page you'll see. It's your main dashboard.

Let's go through the main sections.

First, the **Back Office** tab. This is where you can see and manage your personal profile information. If you need to update your address or email, you can do it here. Most of this portal is self-service.

The Back Office is also where you'll find your reports. This is important for tracking your applications. As you submit enrollments, you'll want to check their status, and the enrollment status report is located here.

Next, let's click on the **Members** tab.

**ACTION:** Click on the **Members** tab.

As you build your book of business with us, this section will function like a traditional Book of Business report, similar to what you'd see with Medicare Advantage carriers. It will show you your members, their effective dates, and other important details.

Okay, let's go back.

The **My Documents** and **Licenses** tabs are where we store your contract paperwork, your E&O, and your insurance licenses. Everything is here for you on the back end.

Now for the most important section for your day-to-day work: the **Sales & Marketing Resources** tab. Let's click on that."

**ACTION:** Click on the **Sales & Marketing Resources** tab.

"This is your main hub for materials.

On the left, you'll see **Downloadable Docs**, and on the right, you'll see **Links**.

Let's start with the downloadable documents.

First, the **Broker Certification Deck**. I highly recommend you download this to your computer. It has great information, including the specific ADL (Activities of Daily Living) requirements for each state, which is crucial for determining eligibility.

Next is the **Service Area List by County & Zip Code**.

**ACTION:** Click on **Service Area List by County & Zip Code**.

"This document is also in your sales kits, but it's very convenient to have it here. We've listed all the ZIP codes for our six states and included the corresponding city and county to make it easy for you.

A quick tip for searching this document: just press **Control + F** on your keyboard. A search bar will pop up.

Let's try it. Can someone give me a ZIP code from their area?"

**(Wait for a participant to give a ZIP code, or use a sample like `32703`).**

**ACTION:** Type the ZIP code into the search bar.

"And just like that, it takes you right to the entry. A very useful quick-reference tool.

Okay, let's go back to the resources page.

You'll also find **Book of Business Letters** here. These are pre-approved, generic letters you can send to your existing clients who might be a good fit for PACE. There’s one for inviting clients to a meeting and another for general outreach.

Which brings me to another point: If you have clients who want to learn more, we can host member meetings at our PACE centers. Just coordinate with your manager, and we can set up a tour. We can even arrange transportation for your members. It's a great way for them to see the center firsthand.

Next, you see the **Co-branded Broker Flyers**.

**ACTION:** Click on the **Co-branded Broker Fliers (fillable PDF)** link.

This will take you to a page with flyers for each state. Let's look at one.

**ACTION:** Scroll to a state and click on a flyer link (e.g., California - English Version).

"We have two types of flyers: one for events and one for general marketing. They are all fillable PDFs.

You can see here there's a space at the bottom. You can type your name, phone number, and any other contact info you want to include, save it, and print it on demand.

If you have a large event and printing becomes costly, just reach out to your manager. We can arrange a print job for you at a local FedEx Kinko’s for you to pick up.

Back on the resources page... you’ll also find the **Broker Handbook**, which has all our policies and procedures, and the **Broker Kit**, which you can download if you run out of physical copies.

At the bottom of this page, you’ll find the **Provider Directories**. I’ll click on that now."

**ACTION:** Click on **Provider Directories**.

"This will take you to that same page with the flyers, just scroll to the bottom.

Here are all the provider directories, broken down by location. This is important because it shows you which specialists, skilled nursing facilities, and long-term care facilities are in our network.

However, please remember that we operate differently than a standard Medicare plan. For hospitalizations, a member can go to any hospital, and we will pay the bill. We don't have the same strict network contracts for hospitals that you might be used to.

Now let's go over how to order your physical kits. Back on the Sales and Marketing Resources page, under **Links**, you'll see **Order Printed Broker Kits**."

**ACTION:** Click on **Order Printed Broker Kits**.

"This takes you to our Dokshop. It notes the maximum order is 25 kits every 30 days, but again, if you have a large event, just contact your manager, and we can get you more.

I'll walk you through an order now.

First, find the kit for your location. Let's use Orlando as an example.

**ACTION:** Click **ADD TO CART** under the "Broker Consumer Kit - FL (Orlando)" item.

"Next, you'll enter the quantity. Since they come in packs of five, ordering a quantity of '5' will get you 25 kits."

**ACTION:** In the Quantity field, type `5`. Click **ADD TO CART**.

"From here, you just click **CHECKOUT**."

**ACTION:** Click the blue **CHECKOUT** button.

"The first time you order, you'll need to enter your shipping address. Click the **EDIT** button."

**ACTION:** Click the blue **EDIT** button.

"A window will pop up where you can fill in your name and shipping information. Once that's done, click **SAVE**."

**ACTION:** Click **SAVE**.

"Then click **CONTINUE** through the next few steps."

**ACTION:** Click **CONTINUE**, then **CONTINUE** again.

"Finally, you'll be asked for order information. This is just for tracking. You can put your state or name in the description, and fill out your name, phone number, and email.

Then, click **SUBMIT ORDER**."

**ACTION:** Click the blue **SUBMIT ORDER** button.

"And that's it! Your order has been submitted. You'll receive a confirmation email with a tracking number, and the kits usually arrive in 2-3 business days.

It’s that simple.

Now, for the final and most important piece: how to enroll someone.

Let's go back to the main portal page.

Right at the top, you'll see **Participant Application**."

**ACTION:** Click on **Participant Application**.

"This is the online enrollment application. The first step is to enter the applicant's ZIP code to confirm they're in a covered service area."

**ACTION:** Type a valid ZIP code into the "Zipcode" field and click **Update**.

"If the area is covered, you'll see the plan details appear. Then, you click **Continue**."

**ACTION:** Click **Continue**.

"This takes you to the application itself. It's a straightforward form—name, address, contact info, date of birth.

It’s similar to a D-SNP application, but with some key differences for PACE. It will ask you about the client's income and their need for help with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Be sure to check the boxes for any ADLs your client needs help with.

It's also important to add any extra notes here. For example, if your client needs help applying for Medicaid, you can note that in the 'Is there anything else you would like to share' box. Our team of experts can help them get qualified.

You’ll also be asked about their living situation. Remember, to be eligible for PACE, they must live in the community—not in a skilled nursing facility. This can be a home, an apartment, or even a board and care home.

Finally, fill in their insurance information, MBI and Medicaid numbers if they have them, and answer the questions about veteran status and Power of Attorney.

Once everything is filled out, you just click **Submit**.

You will then receive a unique confirmation number for the application, and our team will take it from there.

It's a very simple and direct process.

Are there any questions on the enrollment application?"

**(Pause for questions)**

"For married couples, you do need to submit two separate applications, one for each individual.

Okay, that covers the key functions of the Broker Portal.

I encourage you all to log in and play around with it. Order your kits, download the flyers, and get comfortable with the platform. It was designed to be as simple and user-friendly as possible.

Thank you all for your time today. If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to reach out."

### üîç Common Broker Issues & Resolution Paths

#### 1. **Portal Access & Login Failures**

Brokers frequently report trouble accessing the InnovAge agent portal‚Äîoften due to incorrect usernames or cached browser sessions. For example, one agent used ‚ÄúShannaford81‚Äù instead of the correct ‚ÄúShannaford8119‚Äù. These issues are typically escalated to [Shaer Munir](https://www.office.com/search?q=Shaer+Munir&EntityRepresentationId=a5f25b9a-9c21-46e0-b1db-a449eea04f14) from Enrollment123, who confirms credentials and recommends incognito sessions or password resets.

**Resolution Flow:**

- Broker Support or Strategic Partnerships (e.g., [Ron Zighelboim](https://www.office.com/search?q=Ron+Zighelboim&EntityRepresentationId=36d7f472-11c2-4a42-a5a4-390aa8a0ca8c)) confirms the issue.
- Technical validation by Enrollment123.
- Broker receives step-by-step reset instructions.
- If unresolved, escalated to portal vendor.

#### 2. **Contract Submission Errors**

Agents sometimes submit contracts via incorrect links or formats. A recent case involved a Greenleaf agent whose submission failed due to a corrupted document or invalid file type.

**Resolution Flow:**

- [Sheri Hernandez](https://www.office.com/search?q=Sheri+Hernandez&EntityRepresentationId=d7333af6-563b-4ee3-8317-9fbb8c7243f8) verifies submission status in Backoffice.
- Enrollment123 investigates document integrity.
- Agent is asked to resubmit using a fresh browser session.

#### 3. **Training Access & Recordings**

There‚Äôs confusion around accessing past training recordings. Brokers often expect recordings to be available via the Broker Resources page or shared folders, but these are not consistently uploaded.

**Resolution Flow:**

- [Sheri Hernandez](https://www.office.com/search?q=Sheri+Hernandez&EntityRepresentationId=d7333af6-563b-4ee3-8317-9fbb8c7243f8) confirms which sessions are recorded.

- Brokers are encouraged to attend live sessions and use the updated calendar.

#### 4. **Commission Structure & Chargebacks**

Commission questions are common, especially around renewal timing and chargebacks for disenrollments. The structure is governed by CMS FMV rates and detailed in the Broker Handbook and contracts.

**Resolution Flow:**

- [Sheri Hernandez](https://www.office.com/search?q=Sheri+Hernandez&EntityRepresentationId=d7333af6-563b-4ee3-8317-9fbb8c7243f8) and [Anthony Horner](https://www.office.com/search?q=Anthony+Horner&EntityRepresentationId=b4267391-7fc6-44ad-bd87-24b8f4319a1e) clarify payout schedules and override agreements.

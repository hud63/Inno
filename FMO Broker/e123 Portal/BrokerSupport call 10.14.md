### **Part 1: Accessing and Managing the Broker Support Inbox (Microsoft Outlook)**

This process covers how to access the shared inbox for broker inquiries and how to interpret common requests.

1.  Open Microsoft Outlook.
2.  In the folder pane on the left side of the screen, scroll down to the **Groups** section.
3.  Click on the group named **Broker Support**. This will open the shared inbox.
4.  You will see a list of emails from various brokers and agents. Common inquiries include:
    *   **Technical Access Issues:** Agents reporting they cannot access enrollment applications or their portal. (e.g., The email from Errick Jones shows an agent trying to access an application and getting a sign-up page instead).
    *   **Confirmation/Thank You:** Simple replies confirming their account is now active. These can be closed after reviewing.
    *   **Intermittent Link Issues:** Agents reporting a link isn't working, which may later resolve itself. It's good practice to test the links yourself and communicate with the agent.

### **Part 2: The Password Reset Workaround**

The standard "Forgot your password?" link on the main portal login page is broken. Follow this specific workaround to help agents and FMOs reset their passwords.

1.  Instruct the user to open a web browser and go to the following URL: `broker.innovage.com/manage`
2.  On this specific page, click the link that says **Forgot My Password**.
3.  Enter the **username and email address** that were used during the original onboarding process.
4.  Click the **Submit** button.
5.  Check your email inbox for a password reset link and click on it to create a new password.
6.  **Crucially**, once the password has been reset, **do not** try to log in from the `/manage` page. Instead, open a new tab and go to the main portal login page at: `broker.innovage.com`
7.  Log in using your username and the new password you just created.

### **Part 3: Managing Agent Information (CRM)**

This section covers how to handle tasks related to agent accounts, such as finding a forgotten username or addressing missing documentation.

**How to Find a Forgotten Username**
If an agent has forgotten their username, you can look it up for them in the CRM.

1.  Navigate to the **Executive/Manager Interactive Dashboard** at `innovage.crm.dynamics.com`.
2.  On the dashboard, locate the box titled **Total Agents** and click on the number inside it.
3.  This will open the **Agent List**. Scroll or search to find the agent's record.
4.  Go to the agent's detail page.
5.  Scroll down to the **Users** section at the bottom. The agent's username will be listed in the **Username** column. You can then provide this to the agent.

**How to Handle Missing E&O Documentation**
The CRM will flag accounts with missing information.

1.  From the **Agent List**, you may see some rows highlighted in red. This indicates an issue with the account. A common flag is "Missing Errors and Omissions".
2.  Click on the agent's **ID number** to open their detailed record.
3.  In the **Tracking** section, you will see the flag **Missing Errors and Omissions**.
4.  **Step 1: Document Your Action.** In the **Notes** section on the right-hand side, create a new note to log your outreach. For example, type: `emailed FMO and agent E&O request`. Click **Save Note**.
5.  **Step 2: Email the Agent and FMO.**
    *   Click the email icon next to the agent's email address in their record. This will open a new Outlook message.
    *   Add the agent's FMO contracting department to the **Cc:** field.
    *   Set the subject line (e.g., "Missing E&O").
    *   Draft a clear message requesting the missing document. Example: *"Hi [Agent Name], can you please email me over your E&O document? When I receive it we will update and activate your account. Respectfully, [Your Name]"*
    *   Send the email.

### **Part 4: Tracking Applications and Leads (CRM)**

This covers the process of checking the status of submitted applications.

1.  Navigate to the **InnSight Team** dashboard at `innovage.crm.dynamics.com`.
2.  On the left navigation pane, click on **Leads**.
3.  The view will default to "My Open Leads". Click the dropdown menu where it says "My Open Leads".
4.  From the list of views, select **AP Pipeline**. (Note: "AP" stands for "Awareness Partner," which includes brokers).
5.  This view shows all leads and applications submitted by partners. To see the most recent ones:
    *   Click the dropdown arrow on the **Created On** column header.
    *   Select **Newer to Older**.
6.  You can now see all incoming applications.
    *   If the **Status Reason** is listed as "Attempted," it means the application has been received but the Inside Sales team has not yet successfully contacted the participant to qualify them.
    *   If the **Status Reason** is "Qualified," the record becomes read-only (locked) and moves to the next stage of the enrollment process.

### Current Broker Support Structure Issues

- Ron phasing out as contractor, no longer appropriate for him to work with broker channel
    
    - Only remaining task: managing broker support emails (not being done effectively)
        
    - Need brokers to know permanent team members: Mark, Sherry, Steven for future stability
        
- Team overwhelmed picking up pieces from management gaps
    
    - Sherry taking calls at 5AM for Florida brokers due to timezone differences
        
    - Constantly in meetings, handling broker issues after hours and early mornings
        
    - Habitual lateness from back-to-back calls running over creating domino effect
        
- Current phone routing system inadequate:
    
    - Calls route to Ron first → inside sales if no answer
        
    - Inside sales has Q&A but not built for technical broker support
        
    - Results in transfers to Sherry during meetings or after-hours callbacks
        
- Steven joining as experienced team member who knows all systems and trains others
    

### Technical Support Requirements - E123 Portal

- E123 agent password reset link completely broken
    
    - Portal claims “in process of fixing” but timeline unknown
        
    - Using manual workaround instructions for all password resets
        
    - Process: guide brokers through admin-initiated reset → email verification → logout → new tab → [broker.innovage.com](http://broker.innovage.com/) login
        
- Username recovery major pain point:
    
    - No “forgot username” functionality exists
        
    - Must manually locate username in admin portal for each request
        
    - Email username directly to brokers with instruction to save for future reference
        
    - Sherry complained to Tony and E123 about missing feature
        
- Best practice recommendations:
    
    - Tell brokers to use email address as username (don’t create unique usernames)
        
    - Common confusion: brokers clicking wrong portal links (Eric Jones example)
        
- Majority of support calls are technical: login failures, portal access, credential issues
    

### Daily Operations & Activation Process

- Angela performs twice-daily activation sweeps (morning and afternoon)
    
    - Reviews all new agent contracts for completeness
        
    - Requirements: valid license (not expired), E&O insurance ($1,000,001), passed certification test
        
    - Auto-activates complete applications, sends welcome email with broker portal credentials
        
- Missing document workflow when applications incomplete:
    
    - System flags missing items in agent account with notes
        
    - Mark/Sherry email FMO and agent requesting specific documents (example: Dana missing E&O)
        
    - Standard email: “Hi [name], can you please email me over your E&O document? We will update and activate your account”
        
    - Document all communications and follow-up actions in system
        
- Sherry currently handling daily sweeps alone due to capacity constraints
    
    - Cannot manage twice-daily schedule, only handling once daily
        
    - Mark ready to take on activation responsibilities with Steven’s training support
        

### Email Management Challenges

- Broker support inbox has 39 total emails, 34 unread (some dating to last Wednesday)
    
    - No flagging, read receipts, or response tracking capabilities in current system
        
    - Only method to track: leave emails unread until responded to
        
    - Multiple team members accessing same inbox creates confusion
        
- Typical email examples requiring immediate attention:
    
    - Eric Jones (Virginia FMO): enrollment application access issues, separate service issue in Richmond market
        
    - Brandy from Gerardy Contracting: “portal not working” (resolved after Sherry tested all links)
        
    - Password reset requests requiring manual admin intervention
        
- Workflow coordination: Sherry CC’ing Mark on responses so he knows what’s been handled
    
- Ron’s email management inadequate, contributing to week-old unresolved issues
    

### CRM Integration Problems

- Critical data sync failure between E123 and Innovage CRM systems
    
    - Applications missing email field don’t transfer to CRM automatically
        
    - Most seniors lack email addresses, causing applications to disappear from system
        
    - Steven identified pattern: applications with emails appear, those without don’t
        
- Inside sales inappropriately treating broker applications as internet leads
    
    - Sending generic follow-up emails to broker-submitted applications
        
    - Example: Diana Journey from Mother’s Care receiving “thank you for inquiring” emails
        
    - Should not send emails to broker applications - need verification call process instead
        
- Missing verification phone number on applications
    
    - E123 supposed to include inside sales number for immediate verification calls
        
    - Brokers should complete verification while still with client to schedule intake
        
    - Tony needs to address missing phone number with E123
        
- Application tracking workflow:
    
    - Use AP (Awareness Partner) pipeline in Insight CRM to monitor broker applications
        
    - Filter by current month to see recent submissions
        
    - Check application status should show minimum “application received”
        
    - Currently showing blank status fields indicating system problems
        

### Team Training & Responsibilities

- Mark’s current capabilities and access:
    
    - Completed first E123 portal training, two more sessions scheduled (today and Friday)
        
    - Has admin access to E123 system confirmed
        
    - Access to Insight CRM activated by Steven
        
    - Maintains organized email chains for reference and answer lookup
        
    - Comfortable with password reset processes
        
- Steven’s role as primary trainer and backup support
    
    - Long-term employee with comprehensive system knowledge
        
    - Training Mark on all processes and serving as escalation point
        
    - Available for calls/texts when Mark encounters unknown issues
        
- Coordination structure: Mark as primary contact with Steven and Sherry as backup references
    

### Next Steps

- IT access request: Mark submitted request for broker support email access (pending response)
    
- Training schedule: Steven to provide CRM application verification training to Mark
    
- Process improvements needed:
    
    - Address missing verification phone number on E123 applications with Tony
        
    - Discuss texting capabilities with Glenn (upcoming meeting in 8 minutes)
        
    - Resolve CRM sync issues for applications missing email fields
        
- Ongoing support: Regular check-ins between Mark, Steven, and Sherry during transition period

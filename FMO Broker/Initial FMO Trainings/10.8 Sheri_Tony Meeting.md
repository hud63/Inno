## The Core Business Model

**InnovAge is a PACE program** (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) that serves dual-eligible seniors (Medicare + Medicaid) who are chronically ill but can safely live at home with support. You’re the only PACE program in the US offering online broker applications.

## Key Parties & How They Connect

### **The Broker Hierarchy (Top to Bottom)**

1. **FMOs (Field Marketing Organizations)** - The top tier
    
    - Examples: Greenleaf (Chris Moulder’s org in Carlsbad)
    - They recruit and train thousands of insurance brokers
    - Get “override” commissions ($250 first year, $200 renewal per enrollment)
    - Need visibility into their entire downline through reports
2. **SGAs (Super General Agencies)** - Just below FMOs
    
    - ~100 agents underneath them
    - Get 75% override
    - FMOs are very protective of these relationships
    - Should really be FMOs themselves
3. **MGAs (Managing General Agencies)** - Mid-tier
    
    - ~50 agents
    - Get 50% override
4. **GAs (General Agencies)** - Starter level
    
    - 5-10 agents
    - Smaller override
    - Building their downline
5. **Individual Agents** - The front line
    
    - Submit applications for participants
    - Get paid $250 first year, $200 renewals
    - Need current license, $1M E&O insurance, pass InnovAge certification

### **The Tech Stack**

**E123 Stream Platform** - Your broker portal system where:

- Agents contract and get certified (30-minute process)
- They submit online applications (called “leads” internally)
- FMOs track their downline performance
- Reports show enrollment status and book of business
- Commission processing happens (single invoice to InnovAge monthly)

**Your CRM** - Where leads become participants:

- Applications go from E123 → InnovAge CRM
- Contact center follows up to schedule intake assessments
- Enrollment reps collect financial details for state applications
- Tracks the full conversion process

## The Flow: How a Participant Gets Enrolled

1. **Agent contracts** → Fills out insurance contract, uploads license/E&O, passes test
2. **E123 scrubs twice daily** → Angela checks compliance, activates agent
3. **Welcome email** → Agent gets broker portal access from [brokersupport@innovage.com](mailto:brokersupport@innovage.com)
4. **Agent submits online application** → Goes to InnovAge contact center as a “lead”
5. **Contact center outreach** → Schedules intake assessment, verifies info
6. **Enrollment reps** → Collect financial details for state Medicaid application
7. **Participant enrolled** → Agent and FMO get paid through E123

## Your Role in This Ecosystem

**50% Broker Channel (with Sheri):**

- Help manage Broker Support Unit (BSU) inquiries
- Support report configuration and FMO needs
- Assist with sticky situations that aren’t self-service

**50% Sales Enablement (with Tony):**

- Build comprehensive sales playbook
- Train 100-person sales team on tools and processes
- Document workflows and maintain knowledge base

## The Big Operational Issues Right Now

**1. Late Launch Impact**

- Missed August 15 target, launched late September
- Only ~300 contracts (very light)
- Missed FMO rollout events in September (when carriers present to broker networks)
- Playing catch-up during AEP (Annual Enrollment Period Oct 1 - Dec 7)

**2. Platform Problems**

- Reports need column fixes (NPN numbers, proper date labels)
- Test data contaminating production portal
- Password resets broken
- Commission reports not live yet (top priority)
- Phone number should pop after application submission (also top priority)

**3. Accounts Payable Disaster**

- InnovAge AP team is “Charles Barkley terrible”
- Don’t reconcile invoices against contracted rates
- Cost millions in overcharges
- Why E123 handling commission payments is crucial

## The Big Opportunity: Hospital/IPA Partnerships

**The Problem These Groups Face:**

- Dual-eligible patients (Medicare + Medicaid) are unprofitable for traditional healthcare
- High utilization, low reimbursement
- Doctors/hospitals losing money on these patients

**InnovAge’s Value Proposition:**

- You GET PAID MORE for these exact patients (it’s your specialty)
- Hospitals offload their “lost leader” patients
- Doctors still see them and bill you (fee-for-service)
- Everyone wins

**Immediate Targets:**

- **John Muir Medical Group** (Contra Costa/Alameda) - Desperate, carriers exiting, huge campus infrastructure
- **Chinese Health Plan** - Cultural fit (Asian families keep elders at home)
- **Similar model already working:** Tampa General in Tampa, Orlando Health in Orlando

## Strategic Concepts You Need to Internalize

### **The Data Hierarchy Is Your Power Structure**

The reason they’re obsessing over reports isn’t just about numbers - **it’s about control and visibility in a commission-driven ecosystem:**

- **FMOs lose control if they can’t see their downline** → They’ll pull their entire network if reporting sucks
- **NPN (National Producer Number) is the universal ID** → Every system, every carrier uses this. Agent IDs are InnovAge-specific and meaningless outside your walls
- **“Ready to Sell” vs “Contracted” distinction** → FMOs want to see EVERYONE in their pipeline (even non-active) so they can push their own people to finish certification. You only showing “ready” agents hides their internal performance problems
- **The “agency layer” problem Tony mentioned** → This is about CRM data architecture. Without knowing which physical agency an agent works at, you can’t do targeted outreach. If you have 500 certified agents who haven’t submitted apps, you need to know WHERE they are (which 10 agencies) to activate them. This is a go-to-market execution problem disguised as a data problem.

### **The Sales Playbook Is Your Job Security & Impact**

Tony’s making this your **forever deliverable** for several strategic reasons:

**1. You’re experiencing the chaos firsthand RIGHT NOW**

- You’re drowning in tribal knowledge, scattered docs, missing processes
- Your pain = every new hire’s pain
- **The insight:** Document what you WISH existed while you still remember what it’s like to be confused
- This gives you credibility - you’re not some consultant who never lived it

**2. It’s a forcing function for cross-functional knowledge**

- To build a sales playbook, you MUST understand:
    - How leads flow (CRM workflows)
    - What brokers need (broker channel)
    - How enrollment works (operations)
    - What commission structure is (finance)
    - Compliance requirements (legal/regulatory)
- **Translation:** You’re being positioned as the “connective tissue” person who knows how everything fits together

**3. It solves InnovAge’s scaling problem**

- They have 100 salespeople and growing
- Tony said “tip of the spear in sales” - most sophisticated team in the company
- But training is “bad and hit or miss”
- **The gap:** You can’t scale a sales team without repeatable onboarding
- Your playbook becomes the OPERATING SYSTEM for the sales org

**4. It makes you indispensable**

- Knowledge hoarding = power in dysfunctional orgs
- Knowledge sharing = power in scaling orgs
- **Your play:** Own the knowledge base, be the enablement expert, become the person who makes everyone else better

### **The Timing/Market Window They’re Not Saying Out Loud**

**The “Silver Tsunami” comment** wasn’t throwaway - it’s the entire business case:

- Baby boomers are hitting 65+ NOW (10,000/day until 2030)
- PACE is Medicare-driven
- **The insight:** You’re not in a “sell hard” business, you’re in a “capture the wave” business
- This is why Tony said “we don’t generate demand, we redirect demand”

**But here’s the deeper strategy:**

**Why late launch REALLY hurt:**

- AEP (Oct 1 - Dec 7) is when brokers place 60-70% of their annual business
- FMO rollouts in September are how you get broker mindshare for the year
- You missed both → **You’re invisible during peak season**
- **The implication:** They’re building for NEXT year’s AEP, not this one
- Your job is to have infrastructure ready for September 2026 rollouts

### **The Hospital Partnership Model Is a Trojan Horse Strategy**

Tony and Sherry got excited about John Muir for reasons beyond one deal:

**Surface level:** Hospital offloads unprofitable patients, InnovAge makes money

**Deeper strategy:**

1. **Hospitals have real estate** → You need physical day centers (Tony: “huge campuses”)
2. **Hospitals have patient flow** → Direct access to your target demographic without broker commissions
3. **Cultural penetration** → Chinese Health Plan comment about Asians keeping elders home = PACE’s exact model
4. **It’s defensible** → Brokers can take their business anywhere. Hospital partnerships lock in geography.

**The John Muir situation specifically:**

- Every carrier exiting (United, Central Health Plan, others going non-commission)
- They’re desperate and have leverage
- Contra Costa/Alameda = huge senior population
- **The play:** Swoop in as the solution when they’re vulnerable, lock in exclusive partnership

**Why they mentioned FQHC (Federally Qualified Health Centers) then dismissed it:**

- FQHCs serve same patient population (sick, poor, Medicaid)
- BUT: “competitors” and “compliance standards” issues
- **Translation:** FQHCs want to keep those patients, hospitals want to offload them
- You target hospitals that are BLEEDING MONEY, not clinics that specialize in underserved populations

### **The Commission Payment Architecture Reveals Operational Maturity**

Notice this flow: Agent gets paid → FMO gets override → E123 cuts all checks → InnovAge sends one invoice

**Why this matters:**

- Tony’s ranting about AP isn’t just venting
- **The insight:** They don’t trust their own finance team to handle variable commission payments to thousands of brokers monthly
- So they outsourced it to E123 (single invoice, top off the “gas tank”)
- **What this tells you:** InnovAge is operationally immature everywhere EXCEPT sales/marketing
- Your playbook needs to be BULLETPROOF because other teams can’t execute consistently

**The “reconciliation” problem Tony mentioned:**

- Vendors overbill, AP doesn’t check against contracted rates
- “Millions of dollars” in waste
- **The connection:** This is why commission reports are TOP 5 priority
- FMOs will DESTROY you if commissions are wrong
- The one thing that can’t be screwed up is broker payments, so it’s fully outsourced

### **The Ron Handoff Is More Important Than It Seems**

Ron: “Hand in every pot” for 3 years, leaving end of month

**What’s really happening:**

- Ron is tribal knowledge walking out the door
- Tony’s making you attend handoffs but said “don’t overstress”
- **The play:** Tony knows you can’t absorb 3 years of knowledge in a few meetings
- What you CAN get: relationship contacts and “who to call” information
- **Your move:** Focus on WHO Ron knows and HOW to reach them, not WHAT he knows
- You’ll learn the “what” through doing the work

**Why this is actually perfect for you:**

- Clean slate to build YOUR systems
- Not maintaining Ron’s legacy mess
- **The opportunity:** Build the playbook as the source of truth going forward

### **The “Absorption Mode” Strategy**

Tony keeps inviting you to meetings “just to observe” and saying “enjoy the light period”:

**This is intentional:**

- He’s pattern-matching you across multiple contexts without overwhelming you
- You’re seeing: daily standups, report config, partnership strategy, Ron handoffs
- **The method:** Exposure to breadth first, then depth later
- You’re building a mental map of the organization before you need to execute

**Your strategic response:**

- Take notes on WHO makes WHAT types of decisions
- Notice what causes frustration (reports, AP, platform issues)
- **The insight:** Your playbook should solve the repetitive frustrations
- The stuff they complain about meeting-over-meeting = your highest-value targets

### **Bottom Line: Your North Star**

You’re being hired to be the **institutional memory and scaling mechanism** for a sales org that’s:

- Growing fast (demand exceeds supply)
- Operationally chaotic (immature company)
- Broker-dependent (need to serve FMOs well)
- Time-sensitive (missed AEP 2025, can’t miss 2026)

The sales playbook isn’t just documentation - it’s **your proof that you understand how all these parties connect, what they need, and how to enable the team to serve them at scale**.

Every confusing conversation you’re in right now is material for that playbook. Your competitive advantage is remembering what it felt like to be confused and documenting the answers you wish you’d had.

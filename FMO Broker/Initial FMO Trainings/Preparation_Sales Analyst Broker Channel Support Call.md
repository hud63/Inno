Sheri,

My involvement in helping build the broker channel since January 2024 has been as follows:

- Dozens of presentations, center tours, lunch-n-learns, etc. to brokers

- Numerous collaborations with Marketing (and Boisterous Labs) to support new broker channel (website pages for agents, email campaigns, broker-specific marketing material, broker events at centers, etc.)

- Sourcing of lead data from numerous publicly available sources (~20,000 leads)

- Technology search to support broker channel

- Stood up Relias for broker certification (now replaced with homegrown solution)

- Established dialogue with AHIP leadership to expand PACE content in its broker training offering. I suggest Matt continue the dialogue through NPA, which facilitated the introduction.

- E123 implementation

- Etc, etc, etc.

As you can see, I've worn a number of hats.

Yes, I'm happy to work with Mark and a forthcoming BSM so that they can accelerate the impact their efforts make. 

I also owe you a list of Colorado brokers who contracted with the original broker agreement. I've been challenged getting into Lextree because of a new authentication protocol. I've reached out to IT and Kevin has sent me instructions. I will get this list to you by the end of the week.

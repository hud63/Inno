### System Overview & Team Knowledge Gaps

- Steven introduced Insight CRM - internal system where E123 application data flows
    
- Team knowledge issues identified:
    
    - Sherry (relatively new) lacks CRM experience
        
    - Can’t pull broker channel data or use system effectively
        
    - Ron leaving soon
        
    - Sean started month before Mark
        
    - Entire team essentially brand new
        

### CRM Systems Relationship

- Two connected platforms:
    
    - [broker.innovage.com](http://broker.innovage.com/) (broker portal for applications)
        
    - Insight CRM (internal Innovage system - Dynamics CRM)
        
- Application flow process:
    
    - Brokers submit via E123 portal
        
    - Data transfers to internal Insight CRM
        
    - Internal team verifies all data
        
    - Inside sales broker leads processed through system
        

### Expected Responsibilities

- Will spend equal time on Insight CRM as on E123
    
- Broker support tasks likely:
    
    - Handle system breaks/data entry errors
        
    - Pull reports for brokers requesting support
        
    - Troubleshoot application processing issues
        
- Tony and Sherry expected to assign these tasks
    

### Access & Next Steps

- Steven to contact CRM team for access:
    
    - Cody and James Bowie (CRM gurus)
        
    - Will expedite access setup
        
- Process requirements:
    
    - Mark submits CRM access ticket first
        
    - Steven sends email CC’ing Mark to Cody/James
        
    - Mark can follow up from there
        

### Action Items

- Mark: Submit CRM access ticket immediately after call
    
- Steven: Email Cody and James Bowie requesting Mark’s CRM access

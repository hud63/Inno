### FMO Promo Ordering Process & Vendor Update

- Current vendor switching in progress due to high costs
    
    - Nancy coordinating new vendor selection
        
    - Existing vendor prices too expensive (hand sanitizer example: was 75¢, now much higher)
        
    - Stainless steel tumblers increased from $8 to $12 each
        
- Ordering process location: Sales & Marketing → scroll to bottom → Promotional Items
    
    - Must email vendor directly and CC Nancy
        
    - System doesn’t allow direct ordering currently
        
- Popular promo items identified:
    
    - Shopping tote bags - very popular with seniors
        
    - Chip clips with magnets - multi-use (fridge magnets + chip clips)
        
    - Jar grippers
        
    - Compact first aid kits that double as ID card holders
        

### Agent Feedback & Customer Service Issues

- John Murray (agent) feedback on first application experience
    
    - Client: George Burby in California, broke, no Medi-Cal yet
        
    - Agent reported client told him “they didn’t even want to help her”
        
    - Steven confirmed in CRM: client was qualified and pushed through pipeline
        
    - Possible miscommunication between agent and client
        
- Carrier verification call process concerns
    
    - John noted this isn’t new - standard order-taking process
        
    - Carriers typically verify understanding of plan details (HMO, doctors, etc.)
        
    - Previous carriers (Humana, UnitedHealthcare) used similar verification methods
        
- All calls are recorded for monitoring purposes
    

### Current Inventory & Distribution

- Steven has ~2,000 tote bags at Tampa location
    
- Proposed distribution: 500 bags each to Sean and Mark
    
- Steven will coordinate with Katie (Tampa) or check with Chris at Crenshaw for additional supplies
    
- Expense reimbursement issue noted: Mark’s card declined, paid $100 out-of-pocket for flyers
    

### Action Items

- Steven: Send vendor contact information to team
    
- Steven: Coordinate with Katie/Chris for bag distribution (500 each to Sean and Mark)
    
- Team: Email Nancy with promo recommendations and requests
    
- Monitor John Murray situation for customer service improvements

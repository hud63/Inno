### Technical Platform Architecture & Issues

- URL migration problems: [broker.innovage.com/manage](http://broker.innovage.com/manage) → [application.innovage.com/manage](http://application.innovage.com/manage)
    
    - Caused by LOA link addition breaking existing functionality
        
    - Most support inquiries result from this change
        
- Password reset system currently broken in back office
    
    - E123 developing workaround until fix deployed (expected next week)
        
    - 5-step manual workaround process:
        
        - Go to [broker.innovage.com/manage](http://broker.innovage.com/manage)
            
        - Click “forget my password”
            
        - Enter username and email from onboarding
            
        - Submit form
            
        - Check email for reset link, then log in at [broker.innovage.com](http://broker.innovage.com/)
            
- Platform distinction: [broker.innovage.com](http://broker.innovage.com/) (consumer-facing) vs. /manage (broker back office)
    
- E123 agent portal credentials: TestTest14Test / Test1234Test123!!!
    

### Broker Support & Communication Systems

- Broker support email management currently inadequate
    
    - No tracking system for response status
        
    - Only bold text indicates unaddressed inquiries

- Planned broker alerts/newsletter system
    
    - Weekly professional flyer-style communications
        
    - Content: training schedules by geographic area, capacity alerts, product updates
        
    - Delivery method: E123 platform vs. internal marketing automation (to be determined with Tony)
        
    - Potential segmentation: FMO alerts vs. regular agent alerts

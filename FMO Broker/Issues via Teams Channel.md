Hi Ron - Can you please assist with a broker that's having a log in challenge with e123? Please include Mark in the conversations/meetings if possible. I'd like for him to use these opportunities as on-the-job learning opportunities. This came in from the inside sales team just a moment ago... Donald Burton: 866- 492- 9239 The technical issues was that he was trying to log into the e123 portal, it would load his information and instead of reflecting the portal it was a blank white screen. He said he has been having this issue since about Monday. I asked him if he reached out to the broker support channel through email or telephone and he communicated by email and then gave us a call as he was still having the loading issue.  I responded to his email yesterday or the day before. I’ll call him now. > **Anthony Horner**

This is the broker support number lol Tony, I called the broker support number and Sheri picked up. Within 15 seconds, I was placed on hold. It’s an issue I previously reported. I found Donald Burtons phone and left him a message. Sorry... Donald's number is 856-882-6607 Yes, I got it from his email. It the Universe was making sure you knew about the issue with the broker support line ![👊🏼](https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net//evergreen-assets/personal-expressions/v2/assets/emoticons//1f44a_oncomingfist/default/100_f_s3.png?v=v22)  COMPLETELY SEPERATE ISSUE

Participant lead name is Gracie Benford. This record was created from an inbound call by Alexandra Crews. Broker was Lamonth Richardson who did NOT submit a lead via the e123 portal. We need to somehow get a record of this lead back into e123 manually to ensure commissions flow as expected. Can you connect with Angela to sort this out?

Lead: Gracie Benford at Orlando center  
Broker: Lamont Richardson  
FMO: Health Plan Markets I emailed this too

**"70% or greater service-connected disability" refers to a Veterans Affairs (VA) disability rating system.**

Here's what this means:

VA Disability Rating System

- The VA assigns disability ratings from 0% to 100% in 10% increments

- These ratings represent the severity of service-connected medical conditions

- A "service-connected" disability means the condition was caused or aggravated by military service

**Why 70% Matters for PACE**

For PACE enrollment, veterans with a 70% or higher service-connected disability rating qualify for Candidate Profile #3 - The Qualified Veteran. This is significant

because:

- No Medicare or Medicaid requirement: Unlike other enrollment paths, these veterans don't need to be enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid

- Age requirement: Must be 55 or older

- Geographic requirement: Must live in a covered service area

- Payment: The VA pays InnovAgeÂ for the member's care under the Elizabeth Dole Act

- Coverage preservation: Veterans maintain their existing VA coverage

**Example Conditions That Might Qualify**

Conditions that could result in a 70%+ rating include:

- Severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

- Major depressive disorder

- Traumatic brain injury (TBI)

- Loss of use of limbs or multiple serious injuries

- Combination of several service-connected conditions

This rating level indicates substantial disability that significantly impacts the veteran's ability to work and perform daily activities, making them eligible for

comprehensive PACE services regardless of their Medicare/Medicaid status.

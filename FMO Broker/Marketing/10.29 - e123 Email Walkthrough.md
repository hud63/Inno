### E123 Email Platform Walkthrough

- Email template system for agent communications
    
    - Welcome emails auto-sent after contracting/certification
        
    - Generic compliance emails for missing requirements (license, documentation)
        
    - Templates duplicated for ad-hoc messaging (Colorado agents kit stop reminder)
        
- Analytics tracking fixed during training session
    
    - Previously duplicated templates weren’t tracking opens
        
    - Now captures deliverability stats and open rates
        
- Do-not-market list protection: 46 out of 300+ agents flagged automatically
    

### Technical Issues & Logo Updates

- Portal loading error affecting website redirects
    
    - Rise (web partner) ticket submitted
        
    - Also experiencing Dynamics form issues beyond event forms
        
    - IT team investigating both platforms
        
- Incorrect logo identified in email templates
    
    - Current version missing registration marker and “life on your terms” branding
        
    - Sandra to provide correct PNG format logo
        
    - Multiple locations need updating
        

### Marketing Materials & Broker Feedback

- Comparison flyer overwhelmingly preferred by agents
    
    - Only flyer brokers use - contains all info plus visual comparison grid
        
    - Originally from Michigan PACE organization, adapted for InnovAge
        
    - Spanish translation urgent need for Florida Hispanic population
        
- Resource page terminology confusing
    
    - “Static” unclear to brokers - suggests changing to “meeting version” vs “non-meeting flyer”
        
    - Agent pulled wrong template, didn’t understand meeting vs non-meeting options
        
- Social media content request emerging
    
    - Agent converting PDFs to Word for social posts (creating formatting issues)
        
    - Need editable social templates and suggested copy
        
    - YouTube channel has existing shareable content
        

### Lead Concepts Vendor Meeting Setup

- Sherry coordinating with Lead Concepts for refreshed recruiting data
    
    - Current Ron-provided list nearly exhausted
        
    - Vendor works with major carriers, highly recommended
        
    - Meeting participants: Sherry, Gina, possibly Nancy (for list acquisition experience)
        

### Action Items

- Sandra: Send correct PNG logo to Mark for template updates
    
- Mark: Forward logo to E123 for implementation across all locations
    
- Jeanie: Check Spanish comparison flyer translation status, expedite if needed
    
- Jeanie: Update resource page language from “static” to clearer terminology
    
- Jeanie: Work with Laura on social media templates and content calendar for brokers
    
- Sherry: Coordinate Lead Concepts meeting with Gina (and potentially Nancy)

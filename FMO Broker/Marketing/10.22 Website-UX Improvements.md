1.  **Implement Collapsible State Sections**

    **Issue:** Currently cluttered design requiring reorganization.
    **Why:** "Collapsible state sections" were documented as a planned improvement but have not been implemented. Brokers struggle to find state-specific information in the current flat layout.

2.  **Add Functional Anchor Navigation**

    **Issue:** No proper navigation within long resource pages.
    **Why:** "Functional anchor navigation" was specifically noted as a needed improvement. Brokers can't quickly jump to relevant sections without scrolling through everything.

3.  **Streamline Language and Event Indicators**

    **Issue:** Full "English" and "Spanish" labels and separate lines for event types are verbose and take up space.
    **Why:** Condensing language labels to abbreviations (e.g., ENG/ESP) and placing event and static content on the same line will create a cleaner, more scannable layout.

4.  **Reformat Broker Resources into a Three-Column Grid**

    **Issue:** The current single-column layout for broker resources is inefficient and requires excessive scrolling.
    **Why:** Moving the broker resources section to the middle of the page and organizing it into a three-column grid will make better use of screen space and allow brokers to find what they need more quickly.

5.  **Prioritize Frequently-Used Resources**

    **Issue:** Infrequently used resources (like training) are placed above frequently accessed materials (like broker kits & user guide).
    **Why:** Brokers have to scroll past content they rarely use to get to critical documents. Placing broker kits and how-to guides above one-time training materials will improve efficiency.

### Meeting Setup & Process Alignment

- Team regroup after initial “mad dash” period when Mark first arrived
    
- Goal: establish operational processes for broker channel marketing support
    
- Participants: Sherry (broker channel lead), Sandra, Nancy, Jeanie (marketing team), Mark (new hire)
    
- Context: Mark recently onboarded, Mitch starting Monday, need structured workflows
    
- Challenge: everyone been working around the clock, time to breathe and systematize
    

### Marketing Request Deadlines & Timelines

- **Primary deadline**: By 5th of each month for following month’s deliverables
    
    - Broker recruitment campaigns
        
    - External events and communications
        
    - Email campaigns requiring build-out
        
    - Collateral creation for external audiences
        
- **Extended timeline**: 3-4 weeks lead time for extensive marketing team support
    
- **Scope clarification needed**: Sandra to email complete requirements list
    
    - Current understanding limited to recruitment campaigns and external events
        
    - Need documentation of all items requiring marketing team involvement
        
    - Will add to departmental process documentation
        
- **Website updates**: Different timeline than external campaigns (not subject to 5th deadline)
    

### Marketing Request Form Process

- **Current challenge**: Email workflows ineffective with multiple team stakeholders
    
    - Jeanie, Nancy, others involved in most broker projects
        
    - Lack centralized visibility and project management
        
- **Enterprise solution**: Asana-connected request form used by rest of organization
    
    - Immediate workflow integration upon submission
        
    - Team visibility for all stakeholders
        
    - Priority flagging and management capabilities
        
    - Connected to existing project management system
        
- **Recent improvements**: Form updated with broker-specific fields
    
    - Based on couple months of broker project experience
        
    - Better captures requirements upfront
        
    - Reduces back-and-forth clarification needs
        
- **Implementation**: Broker team to transition from email to form for all requests
    
    - Syncs with existing marketing team processes
        
    - Allows proper project tracking and resource allocation

    - Equipment drop-off: 11 AM coordinated with Kyle
        
    - Final email sent this morning (forwarded to Mark and team)

    - Ron built relationships over ~3 years in Colorado territory
        
    - Mitch Halle taking over as Colorado broker sales manager
        
    - Need coordination with Tony (IT) for number reassignment vs. new assignment
        
    - Sherry to connect with Tony and Mark on process
        
- **Email distribution cleanup required**:
    
    - Multiple people currently receiving broker inquiries (Strider, Sean, others)
        
    - [inquiries@innovage.com](mailto:inquiries@innovage.com) routing unclear
        
    - Mark managing [brokersupport@innovage.com](mailto:brokersupport@innovage.com) as central point
        
    - Need IT assistance to identify current distribution list members
        
- **Marketing materials requiring updates**:
    
    - Broker handbook (primary marketing deliverable)
        
    - Broker and FMO training decks (Mark and Sherry handling internally)
        
    - Website landing pages and routing (Jeanie managing)
        
    - Any routing requests and contact forms
        

### New Team Member Onboarding

- **Mitch Halle details**:
    
    - Starts Monday as Colorado broker sales manager
        
    - Email: [firstname.lastname@innovage.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@innovage.com) (spelling: h-e-l-l-e, system shows h-e-l-l-e)
        
    - Reports to Sherry per system
        
    - Experienced broker sales manager from other carriers
        
    - Knows brokers and FMOs, ready to hit ground running immediately
        
- **Prisma setup**: Sandra already initiated account creation
    
    - Should receive setup email upon Monday start
        
    - Account ready for immediate use
        
- **Onboarding documentation gap**: Need comprehensive process guide
    
    - Sherry struggled with own onboarding (only been there couple months)
        
    - Recently onboarded Sean, now Mitch, then Mark
        
    - Department needs standardized onboarding materials including marketing workflows
        

### Website & Portal Structure

- **Current agent/broker landing page status**:
    
    - Basic page exists at specific URL (Jeanie managing)
        
    - Content acceptable for now, bigger priorities exist
        
    - Two contact buttons route to [inquiries@innovage.com](mailto:inquiries@innovage.com) (now routing to broker support)
        
- **Required updates**:
    
    - Remove “See if you qualify” button (direct sales lead generator, inappropriate for broker audience)
        
    - Add “For Brokers” tab to main website navigation
        
    - Under Related Links section: add broker portal login link, training calendar link
        
    - Change email routing from inquiries to [brokersupport@innovage.com](mailto:brokersupport@innovage.com)
        
- **Portal technical limitations**:
    
    - e123 system allows maximum 5 links in sales/marketing resources section
        
    - Current allocation: broker certification deck, county/city ZIP code service areas, book of business letters, plus 2 others
        
    - Ron identified constraints from day one due to 50+ flyers requiring external hosting
        
    - Downloadable docs link routes to external website rather than portal-hosted content
        
- **Navigation strategy**:
    
    - Public-facing page for potential brokers (basic information, training calendar access)
        
    - Portal-secured resources for contracted brokers only
        
    - Clear distinction between prospect vs. contracted broker resources
        

### Training & Resource Development

- **Mark’s current projects**:
    
    - Building user guides and job aids for broker channel
        
    - Step-by-step portal navigation assistance
        
    - Video training development (originally planned Loom, Tony suggested alternatives needed)
        
    - Focus on technology navigation and internal process training
        
- **Process documentation initiative**:
    
    - Creating department-specific broker channel guide
        
    - “How we do things at InnovAge” for new broker managers and support team
        
    - Will replace current ad-hoc training approach
        
    - Include marketing team workflow integration
        
- **Departmental need**: Standardized onboarding materials
    
    - Components: Prisma platform setup for new hires
        
    - Email and phone number collection for system setup
        
    - Ensure new brokers can hit market immediately upon onboarding
        
- **Tool suggestion**: Scribe for interactive training resources
    
    - Screenshots, videos, audio capabilities
        
    - More interactive than basic video tools
        
    - Marketing team uses with automation vendor successfully
        
    - Mark already tested free version, would need licenses for full functionality
        

### Portal Content Management

- **Current portal structure**:
    
    - Back office: reports, enrollment status, commission statements
        
    - Documents section
        
    - Online application submission
        
    - Sales/marketing resources (5-link limit)
        
- **Content distribution strategy**:
    
    - Limited high-priority items remain in portal
        
    - Bulk resources (50+ flyers, directories, broker kit) hosted externally
        
    - Training calendar external due to mixed audience (prospects vs. contracted)
        
    - External hosting provides better control over registration and access
        
- **Planned improvements**:
    
    - Replace less useful links (PACE program finder, National PACE Association)
        
    - Add Mark’s training videos and resources
        
    - Focus on most relevant, frequently-used broker tools
        
    - Consider adding InnovAge website link, other practical resources

    - Steven approved final test emails late last night
        
    - Expecting incoming leads from morning launch

### Current SMS Platform Roadblock

- Tony rejected e123 SMS campaigns due to conflict with internal initiative
    
- Marketing rolling out SMS platform within Dynamics CRM
    
    - Using same module as email campaigns
        
    - Phone numbers designated and tested
        
    - Testing response handling and visibility workflows
        
- Tony wants single SMS source to avoid confusion
    
- Platform close to launch but timeline unclear
    

### e123 Integration Status

- Portal currently standalone, not connected to CRM
    
- Supposed to be fully integrated for agent enrollment and lead feeds
    
- Application status report feeds due by end of week
    
- Broker information integration much further down development pipeline
    
- Applications started coming in early October (3.5 weeks ago)
    

### Broker Communication Strategy

- Cannot create targeted broker audiences until CRM integration complete
    
- Need “contracted broker” flag in CRM for segmentation
    
- Mark meets weekly with Tony and IT on CRM/marketing topics
    
- Will discuss broker audience creation once current feeds delivered
    

### Video Content for Recruitment

- Plan to embed video in recruitment “flyers” (email campaigns)
    
- Two-part approach:
    
    - Video explaining why Innovage benefits brokers
        
    - Link to [innovage.com/agents](http://innovage.com/agents) page
        
- Goal: stand out from 100+ daily carrier emails brokers receive
    
- Video can be clicked/watched on mobile while driving
    

### Tool Licensing and Production

- Scribe approved for user guide creation (not video testimonials)
    
- Marketing team can assist with testimonial-style videos
    
- Can embed links and QR codes in digital/physical materials
    
- IVR recordings for dedicated phone numbers identified as high-ROI next step
    

### Next Steps

- Mark: Follow up with Tony on Scribe licensing progress
    
- Weekly CRM meeting: Discuss broker segmentation once feeds complete
    
- Training calendar updates to be shared when finalized

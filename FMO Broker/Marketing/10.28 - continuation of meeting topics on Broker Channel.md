### Provider Directory Updates

- Multiple directories have formatting inconsistencies
    
    - Some use proper letterheads, others are raw Excel conversions
        
    - Colorado directory updated yesterday with correct letterhead
        
    - Current letterheads show outdated “Mind of Age” branding instead of Innovage
        
- Jeanie will standardize all directories
    
    - Apply current Innovage letterheads to all documents
        
    - Remove extra blank pages from conversions
        
    - Ensure consistent look and feel across all states
        
- Missing specialty information on many provider listings
    
    - Only shows “provider name” without specialties
        
    - Causing complaints from FMOs and agents
        

### Broker Handbook Updates

- Phone number confusion for Mitch (replacing Ron)
    
    - Multiple numbers mentioned in different emails
        
    - Unclear if Ron’s old cell number porting to Mitch
        
    - Mark to follow up with Tony for clarification
        
- Release policy language needs revision
    
    - Current wording unclear about when 3-month clock starts
        
    - Should clarify: clock begins when release is requested via email to broker support
        
    - Sherry will consolidate all markup changes into single email
        
- Mark’s title addition: “Broker Support”
    
    - Replacing “Sales Analyst” to avoid confusion
        
    - David not ready to be added yet - too premature
        

### Broker Communications Strategy

- Current data list nearly exhausted
    
    - 20,000 contacts hit multiple times already
        
    - Risk of spam complaints if reused too frequently
        
    - No established process for acquiring new lists
        
- Lead Concepts potential vendor
    
    - Recommended by Sean (formerly at Aetna)
        
    - Sherry to set up call with Reggie
        
    - Include Sandra, Nancy, Jeanie, and Mark
        
- Internal communications through E123 portal
    
    - Allows targeting by state (e.g., Colorado only)
        
    - Instant distribution to contracted agents
        
    - Need to verify email safeguards and reporting capabilities
        

### E123 Portal Functionality Review

- Email capabilities concerns
    
    - No reporting on recent email campaigns
        
    - Mark scheduling training to address functionality gaps
        
    - Need confirmation of spam protection measures
        
- Text notifications not enabled
    
    - Feature available but not activated during setup
        
    - Ron intended to have full communication capabilities
        
    - Mark to inquire about enabling text functionality
        
- Agent link placement issues
    
    - Current setup requires password for contract links
        
    - Should integrate contract links directly into agent back office
        
    - No need for separate landing pages
        

### Next Steps

- Mark: Clarify Mitch’s phone number situation with Tony
    
- Mark: Schedule E123 walkthrough with Jeanie for communication features
    
- Mark: Address email reporting and text enablement in E123 training
    
- Sherry: Set up Lead Concepts vendor call
    
- Sherry: Consolidate all broker handbook changes into single email
    
- Jeanie: Update all provider directories with current Innovage branding
